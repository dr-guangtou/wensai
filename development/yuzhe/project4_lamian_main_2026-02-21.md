## Progress

- `f62158b`: implemented `search` command with typed filters and integration tests.
- `a2d1f90`: implemented `update` command and caption migration support.
- `83b3ee9`: implemented `export` command with JSON/YAML output.
- `ccbcd87`: completed Phase 1.5 Wave A (`query`, `import`, `doctor`) and related docs/tests.
- `b896e99`: completed Phase 1.5 Wave B (`collection`, `bundle`) with integration coverage.
- `d41d970`: added full sequential workflow integration test (`init -> inject -> update -> tag -> link -> search -> export`).
- `f8e94c7`: completed Phase 1.8 Wave 1 hardening and batching changes.
- `60439e6`: completed Phase 1.8 hardening wave updates, including shared tag validation reuse.
- `2664b7d`: completed Phase 1.8 Wave 3 crash-consistency hardening for bundle import.
- Added `project4/lamian/src/tag_validation.rs` and refactored `tag/search/query` to reuse shared normalization/validation semantics.
- Reworked bundle import in `project4/lamian/src/bundle.rs` to stage managed files, journal import state, and recover interrupted imports before promoting files to final paths.
- Added bundle recovery unit tests for committed and staged journal scenarios.
- Updated trackers and specs during the day: `project4/TODO.md`, `project4/lamian/docs/TODO.md`, and `project4/lamian/docs/SPEC.md`.
- Added handover and next-session prompts at key checkpoints under `project4/journal/`.
- Full verification gate was run and passed during the hardening waves: `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`.

## Lessons Learned

- Fast-forwarding major waves through small slices (`schema -> command/service -> tests -> full gate`) kept change risk controlled across multiple phases in one day.
- Reusing a single validation module (`tag_validation`) reduced drift risk between command paths while preserving existing CLI error contracts.
- Crash consistency requires an explicit recovery contract; staged writes plus a journal is more robust than writing final files before DB commit.
- Full-gate verification after each hardening wave caught issues early and avoided cross-wave regressions.
- Keeping TODO/spec/journal artifacts in sync at each milestone made branch handoff and merge checkpoints straightforward.

## Key Issues

- Remaining immediate hardening item is `P4-420 / L-190`: add `doctor` file-path integrity checks for missing/non-regular figure file paths.
- Next action: create a new feature branch from `main` for Wave 4 and implement `doctor` checks with tests and full-gate verification.
- Open policy decision to confirm in implementation: whether `doctor --fix` remains DB-only for file-path integrity findings or supports any safe filesystem-side remediation.
- Additional hardening backlog still pending includes bundle portability/domain-validation parity and expanded bundle preflight/conflict controls.
