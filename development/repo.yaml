# YAML file to keep tracks of the development projects I am working on.
# Documents:
# The main keyword is the name of the repository. e.g., `huoguo`, `isoster`
# `instro`: brief introduction of the development
# `github`: the URL of the Github repository.
# `local`: directory of the local repo. This is a list, because the repo could happen on multiple computers, including the Mac Studio in my office, my MacBook Air, and Mackbook Pro.
# `related`: the projects this repo is related to, using the file structure within this Obsidian Vault (wensai). This is also a list. One repo can relate to multiple topics.
# `status`: the current status of the development, including `being_planned`, `just_beginning`, `under_development`, `implemented`, and `published`.
# `resume`: the session ID for different coding agents to resume the development. The name of the key is the coding agents' CLI names, like `claude`, `codex`, `kimi-cli`, `gemini`. `resume` is optional.
