# Session Handover — 2026-03-06

## Goal
Polish S23b photo-z QA figures to match the established s19a HSC photo-z conventions. The next session should continue refining the remaining QA figures (fig_01–fig_07, fig_09–fig_11).

## Completed This Session

### 1. S/N Cap (Error Floor)
- Added `SNR_CAP = [100, 100, 100, 80, 50]` per-band and `apply_snr_cap()` function
- Applied in `prepare_all_folds()` after extinction correction, before skynoise estimation
- 367k/443k objects (83%) have at least one band capped
- Fold 2 re-run: coverage_68 improved 0.216 → 0.427, sigma_NMAD improved 0.122 → 0.094, DESI sNMAD 0.038 → 0.026

### 2. QA Metrics Overhaul (s19a-style)
- Ported `biweighted_bias()` from `../hsc_photoz/notebook/s19a_helper.py`
- Added `qa_stats()` with all 7 metrics: bias_conv, bias_bw, sigma_conv, sigma_bw, f_outlier_conv, f_outlier_bw, avg_loss
- Added `qa_mag_bins()` and `qa_z_bins()` with fixed-width bins (s19a convention), replacing percentile-based bins
- `MAG_MAX_WIDE = 25.5` constant for WIDE-depth i-band cut

### 3. New QA Figure (`fig_08_qa_metrics`)
- Replaced old `fig_08_metrics_vs_zbin` + `fig_09_metrics_vs_magbin` with `plot_qa_metrics()` in `s23b_plot.py`
- 2×2 layout: metrics scatter (top) + delta_z violin (bottom), vs i-mag (left) + vs z_spec (right)
- s19a marker style: solid=biweighted, empty=conventional; ○=bias, □=sigma, ▽=outlier, ×=loss
- Per-source figures: `fig_08_qa_metrics_all.png`, `_desi.png`, `_cosmosweb.png`
- Wide aspect ratio (18×10 inches)

### Reference Files Read
- `../hsc_photoz/script/s19a/photoz/s19a_photoz.py` — `qa_stats()`, `qa_mag_bins()`, `qa_z_bins()`, `cross_validation_s19a()`
- `../hsc_photoz/notebook/s19a_plot.py` — `plot_qa_mag_z()` style (markers, colors, layout)
- `../hsc_photoz/notebook/s19a_helper.py` — `biweighted_bias()` implementation

## In Progress (Not Finished)
- **Other QA figures need polish**: fig_01 (scatter 4-panel), fig_02 (residual histogram), fig_03/04 (residual vs z/mag), fig_05 (PIT+QQ), fig_06 (N(z)), fig_07 (example PDFs), fig_09 (credible coverage), fig_10 (N(z) by source), fig_11 (metrics by source) — all still use basic matplotlib style, not s19a conventions
- **Old fig_08/fig_09 functions** still defined in runner but no longer called — can be removed
- **`compute_source_binned_metrics()`** defined but no longer called — can be removed
- **KDE bandwidth sweep** needed to close remaining coverage gap (0.43 vs 0.68 nominal)
- **Remaining folds 3-9** not yet run with S/N cap

## Problems / Blockers
- PDF coverage still below nominal (0.43 vs 0.68) even with S/N cap — needs KDE bandwidth tuning
- DESI DR1 zerr are all sentinels (-1.0); z-proportional bandwidth is the workaround
- COSMOSWeb dominates sample (68%) and pulls overall metrics down

## Key Decisions
- **S/N cap values**: [100, 100, 100, 80, 50] for grizy — matches s19a's convention (`s2n=[100,100,100,80,80]`) with y-band lowered to 50 given S23b's noisier y photometry
- **Fixed-width bins** for QA (mag_step=0.5, z_step=0.2) instead of percentile-based — percentile bins gave misleading equal counts
- **z_spec binning** for redshift-axis QA (not z_phot) — assesses performance at known redshifts
- **WIDE mag cut at 25.5** — appropriate for HSC Wide-layer depth; DUD would use different cut

## Branch State
- Branch: `main` (at `300a55a`, up to date with origin)
- Uncommitted changes: yes — `s23b/run_photoz_s23b.py` (+301 lines), `s23b/s23b_plot.py` (+134 lines)
- No commits made this session (changes are uncommitted)

## Files Modified This Session
- `s23b/run_photoz_s23b.py` — S/N cap, biweighted_bias, qa_stats, qa_mag_bins, qa_z_bins, per-source QA
- `s23b/s23b_plot.py` — `plot_qa_metrics()` rewritten with s19a style + violin panels

## Output Files Generated
- `s23b/output/undeblended/figures/fig_08_qa_metrics_all.png`
- `s23b/output/undeblended/figures/fig_08_qa_metrics_desi.png`
- `s23b/output/undeblended/figures/fig_08_qa_metrics_cosmosweb.png`
- `s23b/output/undeblended/results/fold_2_results.npz` (re-run with S/N cap)
