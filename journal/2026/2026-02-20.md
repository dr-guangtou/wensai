# 2026-02-20

## Focus & TODOs

- `isoster` test using Huang2013 sample: focusing on the failed cases in round 1.
- `lamian`: personal visual database's plan
### Reminder

- Arrange Wenli Xu's visit. 
## Journal 
- `openclaw` on the MacStudio: 
	- Re-config `openclaw` to use `Discord` bots. 
		- [[Agentic AI - Setup Discord for OpenClaw]]
	- `yuzhe/agentic_daily`: a script to fetch daily newsletters about AI development using RSS sources.
- `yuzhe`:
	- Project 4 has completed planning/bootstrap and is now on main with a decision-locked spec, risk/decision docs, journals, and extraction-ready project4/lamian structure (standalone docs, license, toolchain, and Rust CLI scaffold with working init + SQLite migrations/tests). We also formalized two workflow accelerators: a reusable main-commit skill and explicit handover/context-window discipline rules in Project 4 and LaMian agent docs to keep multi-session development stable.
	- Phase 1 is in late-stage progress: init, inject, full tag (add/remove/rename), and link (add/remove) are implemented with typed validation and error handling, and integration tests pass on real fixtures. Remaining Phase 1 work is update, search, export, plus one full end-to-end CLI workflow test to close the phase gate.
- `isoster`:
	- Today we fixed Huang2013 robustness by making sb/sb_err undefined for `intens <= 0`, adding mandatory non-negative validation for all error columns, and setting the default initial sma0 to a fixed 6.0 pixels. We validated with 8 passing unit tests, re-ran ESO185-G054 in update mode with all extraction/QA stages succeeding, and merged the work into main at commit ae1c6ae.
