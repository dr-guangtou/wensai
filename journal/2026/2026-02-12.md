## 3. TIL

- New tool - `roam-code`: Instant codebase comprehension for AI coding agents.
- Vibe coding: Claude has a vision model; up to 100 images per request; can pass a URL directly; token cost = (width x height) / 750; files API support (upload once, reference by file_id).
- New tool - `Memoh`: Multi-Member, Structured Long-Memory, Containerized AI Agent System; a more contained and safe version of `openclaw`; Every bot has an independent container and memory system, which allows them to edit files, execute commands, and build themselves.
- Official `Obsidian` CLI: https://help.obsidian.md/cli, a command line interface that lets you control Obsidian from your terminal for scripting, automation, and integration with external tools; Anything you can do in Obsidian can be done from the command line. Obsidian CLI even includes developer commands to access developer tools, inspect elements, take screenshots, reload plugins, and more.
- New tool - `Firecrawl`: Convert websites to LLM-ready markdown/data. Scrape pages, crawl sites, search the web, extract structured info. Includes AI agent for autonomous data gathering: https://claude.com/plugins/firecrawl (Not free)
- New tool - `doctra`: https://github.com/AdemBoukhris457/Doctra Doctra is a powerful Python library for parsing, extracting, and analyzing document content from PDFs. It combines state-of-the-art layout detection, OCR, image restoration, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide comprehensive document processing capabilities.
- New tool - `yazi`: https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi Blazing fast terminal file manager written in Rust, based on async I/O.
- New tool - `langextract`: A Python library for extracting structured information from unstructured text using LLMs with precise source grounding and interactive visualization from Google https://github.com/google/langextract Require an API Key.
- New tool - `claude-mem`: A Claude Code plugin that automatically captures everything Claude does during your coding sessions, compresses it with AI (using Claude's agent-sdk), and injects relevant context back into future sessions. https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem
- New tool - `get-shit-done`: https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done A light-weight and powerful meta-prompting, context engineering and spec-driven development system for Claude Code and OpenCode.
