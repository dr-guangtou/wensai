### AI And Agentic Coding:

- New tool: `OpenViking` - https://github.com/volcengine/OpenViking/ 
	- OpenViking is an open-source context database designed specifically for AI Agents.
	- OpenViking unifies the management of context (memory, resources, and skills) that Agents need through a file-system paradigm, enabling hierarchical context delivery and self-evolution.
- New tool: `arscontexta` - https://github.com/agenticnotetaking/arscontexta 
	- Claude Code plugin that generates individualized knowledge systems from conversation. You describe how you think and work, have a conversation , and get a complete second brain in the form of markdown files you own.
- New tool: `zvec` - https://github.com/alibaba/zvec 
	- A lightweight, lightning-fast, in-process vector database
- New tool: `schematic` - https://github.com/blader/schematic 
	- Claude Code / Codex skill: reverse engineer a product & technical spec from a git branch.
- New tool: `visual-explorer` - https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer 
	- Agent skill + prompt templates that generate rich HTML pages for visual diff reviews, architecture overviews, plan audits, data tables, and project recaps
- Tutorial: `no-magic` - https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/no-magic
	- `no-magic` is a curated collection of single-file, dependency-free Python implementations of the algorithms that power modern AI. Each script is a complete, runnable program that trains a model from scratch and performs inference — no frameworks, no abstractions, no hidden complexity.
	- This project is directly inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's](https://github.com/karpathy) extraordinary work on minimal implementations — particularly [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore), and the `microgpt.py` script that demonstrated the entire GPT algorithm in a single dependency-free Python file.
