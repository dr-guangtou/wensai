## Focus & TODOs

- Improve the workflow in `wensai`
- `isoster` test using Huang2013 sample: focusing on the failed cases in round 1.
## Journal 
- `wensai`:
	- Upgraded the /journal slash-command to write vault-aware development journal entries into `wensai/development/[REPO_NAME]/` with Obsidian-compatible front matter, added `journal/new_daily.sh` to safely scaffold daily notes from the template, and created `README.md` at the vault root documenting the directory structure and all configuration files and scripts — also updating `AGENTS.md` to codify the vault + documentation tag convention for root-level reference notes.
