# 2026-02-19

## Focus & TODOs

- Improve the workflow in `wensai`
- `isoster` test using Huang2013 sample: focusing on the failed cases in round 1.
## Journal 
- `wensai`:
	- Upgraded the /journal slash-command to write vault-aware development journal entries into `wensai/development/[REPO_NAME]/` with Obsidian-compatible front matter, added `journal/new_daily.sh` to safely scaffold daily notes from the template, and created `README.md` at the vault root documenting the directory structure and all configuration files and scripts — also updating `AGENTS.md` to codify the vault + documentation tag convention for root-level reference notes.
- `yuzhe`:
	- Project 1: Today’s full progress (from git history + `docs/journal/2026-02-19-project1-review.md`) was a complete reliability-and-governance closeout: you fixed threshold schema usage and digest naming, added fast summary fallback when LLM is unavailable, hardened cross-year digest discovery/dedup, resolved medium-priority issues (provider order, timeout propagation, entrypoint/docs drift), and enforced CI quality gates for ruff + pytest.
	- After that, you closed review item 9 by adding `docs/SPEC.md` and `docs/todo.md`, ran a live confidence check (`--debug --use-llm-scoring --limit 3 --no-summary`) plus final lint/tests, and reorganized docs by moving pipeline design into `docs/pipeline-architecture.md` and deleting stale `CHANGELOG_3STAGE.md` (3bdd5b2), and finally added the new custom output directory feature `--output-dir/--dir` with docs/tests (679d684, currently on feat/output-dir-option).
