# 2026-02-18

## Journal 

- In Spring Festival holiday season. 
- Vibe coding: 
	- Codex: create a `handover` and `journal` skills. 
	- Install the `obsidian-cli` skill: `npx skills add https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills --skill obsidian-cli`
- `wensai`: 
	-  Upgraded ~/.claude/commands/journal.md to write vault-aware entries into development/[REPO_NAME]/ in the Obsidian vault
	- Added vault discovery (Obsidian CLI → python3 fallback → local fallback)
	- Added collision-safe filename logic (_2, _3 suffixes)
	- Added Obsidian front matter + structured sections
	- Verified full pipeline: CLI returns correct path, dest dir exists, file free
	- Also: AGENTS.md expanded, repo.yaml updated, template_journal.md refined
## Idea

## TIL 

- New tool: Mockdown - https://www.mockdown.design/ 
	- Design a UI or webpage in Markdown and pass it to an agent. 
- Tutorial: `Codex` doesn't have a Slash Command, but one can use Agent Skills:
	- https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills
	- `$HOME/.agents/skills`
- New tool: Obsidian web clipper: https://obsidian.md/clipper
