## Focus & TODOs

## Journal 
- `hsc_sandbox`:
	- Begin to work on the roadmap.
- `isoster`:
	- [[isoster_main_2026-02-21]]
	- Updated the Huang2013 QA figure renderer to improve readability by adding a small right-edge x-axis margin across shared 1-D panels and by giving stop=4/stop=5 distinct high-contrast color/marker styles instead of ambiguous black open circles. Then, regenerated the full ESO185-G054 QA set (mock1-4) via the afterburner only, with all method and comparison QA outputs completing successfully.
	- Made the Huang2013 mock3 QA pipeline method-consistent and CoG-complete by switching photutils 2-D reconstruction to build_ellipse_model and fixing the isoster QA CoG point dropouts via robust CoG-source harmonization.
	- Reintroduced photutils-parity stop_code=2 handling for max-iteration isoster fits (with full-photometry backfill), aligned policy/tests/docs, and produced matched mock3 isoster+photutils outputs plus a direct stop-code/CoG comparison report.
	  - 7c29d4b Emit max-iteration stop_code=2 and align parity docs/tests
	  - 8628412 Fix integration stop-code assumptions and test import stability
	  - 7abe175 Add handover journal notes for stop-code parity session
- `yuzhe/project4` - a.k.a `lamian`:
	- [[project4_lamian_main_2026-02-21]]
	- This session completed Phase 1.5 Wave A end-to-end (import and doctor with JSON contracts and tests), merged that work to main, started feat/lamian-phase-1-5-wave-b, implemented Wave B Slice 1 (migration v4 for collections/collection_items) and Slice 2 (collection create|add|remove|list|delete with integration tests), kept docs synchronized, and produced handover files for the next clean session.
	- Phase 1.8 Wave 1 delivered the three target fixes: tag rename now uses a precomputed, tag_id-based plan to prevent corruption, link remove now allows self-link cleanup while link add still blocks self-links, and the crate/tooling was made Rust 2021-compatible with full fmt/clippy -D warnings/test passing.
	- Wave 2 (P4-418 / L-188) introduced a shared tag normalization/validation module in project4/lamian/src/tag_validation.rs and refactored project4/lamian/src/tag.rs, project4/lamian/src/search.rs, and project4/lamian/src/query.rs (via project4/lamian/src/main.rs) to reuse it while preserving each command path’s existing error semantics; this is captured in the merged commit 60439e6.
	- Wave 3 (P4-419 / L-189) hardened bundle import crash consistency by changing managed-file handling to a staged-write flow with an on-disk import journal, so files are promoted to final paths only after DB commit, and interrupted imports can be recovered deterministically on the next run. I also added focused recovery tests (committed and staged journal scenarios), and the full gate (cargo fmt --all, cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings, cargo test) passed before merging to main.

## Idea

## TIL 

### Astro: 
- Roman is completely assembled at @NASAGoddard and is undergoing final tests before being shipped to @NASAKennedy , where it will be prepped for launch!
- LoTSS-DR3 data release: 
	- [Largest Ever Radio Sky Survey Maps the Universe in Unprecedented Detail](https://www.astronomie.nl/nieuws/en/largest-ever-radio-sky-survey-maps-the-universe-in-unprecedented-detail-4801)
- Candidate Dark Galaxy-2 (CDG-2): 
	- [Hubble, Euclid & Subaru uncover dark galaxy](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Hubble_Euclid_Subaru_uncover_dark_galaxy)
- MeerKAT - HATLAS J142935.3–002836 - Hydroxyl megamasers
	- [UP-led team detects record-breaking ‘cosmic laser’ halfway across the universe](https://www.up.ac.za/research-matters/news/led-team-detects-record-breaking-cosmic-laser-halfway-across-universe)
- M31-2014-DS1: 
	- [Scientists Capture the Clearest View Yet of a Star Collapsing Into a Black Hole](https://news.columbia.edu/news/scientists-capture-clearest-view-yet-star-collapsing-black-hole)
### Coding:

- Snippet: Claude Code stores session state in `~/.claude/session-env/<session-id>/`. The most recently modified directory name is always the current session. So anytime a command needs it: `ls -t ~/.claude/session-env/ | head -1`
- Claude Code on desktop can now preview your running apps, review your code, and handle CI failures and PRs in the background.
- Claude Code now includes built-in git worktree support in the Desktop App and CLI. Agents can run in parallel without interfering with one another. Each agent gets its own worktree and can work independently.
- New tool: `marimo`: https://marimo.io/blog/python-not-json
	- `marimo` is the only open-source Python notebook that doubles as a Python script and module. This yields a great developer experience for both humans and agents.
	- `marimo` skills: https://docs.marimo.io/guides/generate_with_ai/skills/
		- `npx skills add marimo-team/skills`
- Tutorial: `slop-guard`: https://github.com/eric-tramel/slop-guard 
	- A rule-based prose linter that scores text 0--100 for formulaic AI writing patterns. No LLM judge, no API calls. Pure regex.
	- See [[Agentic AI - Slop Guard Prose Linter for AI-Assisted Writing]]
- `exponax`: https://github.com/Ceyron/exponax
	- Efficient Differentiable n-d PDE Solvers in JAX.
- `agents.md`: https://agents.md/
	- A simple, open format for guiding coding agents.
- `claude-obsidian-assistant`: https://github.com/nemocake/claude-obsidian-assistant
	  - A starter Obsidian vault wired for Claude Code. 
- `OpenClaw-DeepReeder`: https://github.com/astonysh/OpenClaw-DeepReeder
	- Turn any URL into long-term memory for your OpenClaw agent.
## Dev Snapshot

> [2026-02-21] isoster: Huang2013 workflow was reorganized to case-scoped outputs with compatibility-preserving manifests and validated cleanup tooling, and the remaining step is a first-20-galaxy single-core batch run plus push decision for main (ahead 1).
