## 1. Journal

- `Isoster`: Today, we closed out Phase 9 end-to-end: enforced libprofit in the mockgal_adapter with explicit preflight validation, replaced the remaining approximate Sersic b_n usage with exact gammaincinv-based helpers across benchmarks/tests, and added a baseline-locked benchmark gate that combines efficiency and 1-D QA metrics while preserving the 2-D system-level caveat. We ran smoke benchmarks, generated/locked quick and full efficiency threshold files, and recorded concrete evidence/output paths in docs/todo.md and docs/lessons.md; then merged the Phase 9 branch back to main. After that, we started Phase 10 prep on a new feature branch by recording the next-batch QA integration plan, adding full lock-refresh command recipes, and scaffolding QA-hook interface fields in run_benchmark_gate.py (--qa-script, --qa-output-subdir, report placeholders) without changing current gate semantics.
- `confeti`:  Merged all four feature branches to main: the function-based API rewrite (refactor/function-api), the 7-test example suite with a sigma_clip crash fix (examples/basic-usage), core.py quality improvements including convergence validation, bilinear interpolation, and adaptive iteration (fix/core-quality), and the noisy benchmark achieving 40/40 pass at SB_lim=26 with percentile level selection (benchmark/noisy). Key finding: gradient-based level selection fails catastrophically for high-Sersic profiles in noise — percentile is both more robust and 2x faster. All 28 unit tests, 63 noiseless models, 40 noisy models, and 7 example tests pass. Pushed to origin. Set up a /handover slash command and status line for future sessions. Only remaining step is tagging v0.2.0.
