### 2. [Anthropic Reported Large-Scale Distillation Attempts (4 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/detecting-and-preventing-distillation-attacks?utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

Anthropic accused DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax of creating over 24,000 fake accounts to generate roughly 16 million Claude interactions aimed at replicating its agentic reasoning, tool use, and coding capabilities.

💡 **Angle**: Test the tool and share a quick review or tutorial.

### 3. [GPT-5 Codex Ran a 25-Hour Coding Sprint (23 minute read)](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/codex/long_horizon_tasks?utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

OpenAI described a long-horizon stress test where GPT-5.3-Codex, given a blank repository and full access, built a design tool over ~25 hours using ~13M tokens and producing ~30k lines of code.

💡 **Angle**: Test the tool and share a quick review or tutorial.

### 4. [Self-Aware Reasoning Efficiency (9 minute read)](https://hzx122.github.io/sage-rl/?utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

SAGE introduces a self-aware sampling approach that enables large reasoning models to decide when to stop thinking, reducing unnecessary computation. Its companion method, SAGE-RL, distills these efficient reasoning patterns into standard pass@1 inference, reporting accuracy improvement with fewer tokens across six challenging math benchmarks.

💡 **Angle**: Share thoughts on how this changes the AI landscape.

### 5. [Very Big Video Reasoning Dataset and Benchmark (4 minute read)](https://video-reason.com/?utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

The VBVR suite introduced over one million video clips across 200 structured reasoning tasks to support large-scale research in video reasoning. It also included VBVR-Bench, a rule-based and human-aligned evaluation framework designed for reproducible assessment and scaling studies.

💡 **Angle**: Summarize the key findings and implications for practitioners.
