## 🏆 Top Picks

The most relevant AI news today:

### 1. [Microsoft tests Researcher and Analyst agents in Copilot (2 minute read)](https://www.testingcatalog.com/microsoft-tests-researcher-and-analyst-agents-in-copilot-tasks/?utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

Microsoft is testing new Researcher and Analyst agents integrated into Copilot's upcoming "Tasks" feature. This feature will allow users to schedule complex prompts, leveraging OpenAI and o3-mini models for research and data analysis. The addition of an "Auto" mode aims to streamline task automation, potentially differentiating Copilot in productivity use cases.

💡 **Angle**: Summarize the key findings and implications for practitioners.

### 2. [Why I don't think AGI is imminent (12 minute read)](https://dlants.me/agi-not-imminent.html?utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

Both CEOs of OpenAI and Anthropic claim that human-level AI is just around the corner. However, Transformers have their fundamental limitations. While they are very powerful and have taught us a lot about what general intelligence is, overcoming these problems will require research that could take decades. The advances that made modern GPTs possible were discovered gradually over several decades, and each discovery came with new and more nuanced issues.

💡 **Angle**: Summarize the key findings and implications for practitioners.

### 3. [Qwen3.5: Towards Native Multimodal Agents (40 minute read)](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3.5&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

Qwen3.5-397B-A17B is the first model in the Qwen3.5 series. The native vision-language model demonstrates outstanding results in reasoning, coding, agent capabilities, and multimodal understanding. It uses an innovative hybrid architecture that fuses linear attention with a sparse mixture-of-experts. While it contains 397 billion parameters, only 17 billion are activated per forward pass. The model supports 201 languages and dialects.

💡 **Angle**: Analyze the agent capabilities and compare with existing solutions.
