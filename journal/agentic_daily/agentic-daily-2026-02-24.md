## 🏆 Top Picks

The most relevant AI news today:

### 1. [ARC-AGI-3 UPDATE (5 minute read)](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2024640940657246235?utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

ARC-AGI-3 is an Interactive Reasoning Benchmark designed to measure an AI Agent's ability to generalize in novel, unseen environments. Opus 4.6 demonstrates better reasoning and use of memory than Gemini 3.1 Pro and solves more levels. Current models may be able to solve ARC-AGI-3 given access to a harness with a simple memory. Memory scaffolds are likely enough for pseudo-continual learning to push us to some self-improvement or research-agent threshold within the next 2 years.

💡 **Angle**: Summarize the key findings and implications for practitioners.

### 2. [Microsoft tests Researcher and Analyst agents in Copilot (2 minute read)](https://www.testingcatalog.com/microsoft-tests-researcher-and-analyst-agents-in-copilot-tasks/?utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

Microsoft is testing new Researcher and Analyst agents integrated into Copilot's upcoming "Tasks" feature. This feature will allow users to schedule complex prompts, leveraging OpenAI and o3-mini models for research and data analysis. The addition of an "Auto" mode aims to streamline task automation, potentially differentiating Copilot in productivity use cases.

💡 **Angle**: Summarize the key findings and implications for practitioners.

### 3. [9 Observations from Building with AI Agents (2 minute read)](https://tomtunguz.com/9-observations-using-ai-agents/?utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

Prototype with the best and polish small gems. Use teams of agents as micromanagers, and experiment with different tools and workflows. Document everything to create improvement loops that improve success rates without manual intervention. Skills are easier to debug than code.

💡 **Angle**: Test the tool and share a quick review or tutorial.

### 4. [OpenAI's acquisition of OpenClaw signals the beginning of the end of the ChatGPT era (7 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/technology/openais-acquisition-of-openclaw-signals-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the?utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

OpenAI's acquisition of OpenClaw marks a strategic shift from conversational AI to autonomous agents capable of executing tasks. OpenClaw's popularity stemmed from its unrestrained, robust functionality, combining tool access, sandboxed code execution, and integration with messaging platforms. This move signals a new phase for enterprise AI as companies race to develop secure, deployable versions of dynamic AI agents.

💡 **Angle**: Test the tool and share a quick review or tutorial.

### 5. [Repeating Prompts (1 minute read)](https://daoudclarke.net/2026/02/19/repeating-prompt?utm_source=tldrai)

*Source: TLDR AI*

When not using reasoning, repeating the input prompt improves performance for popular models without increasing the number of generated tokens or latency. It is interesting that tricks like this are still possible despite the amount of work being put into improving large language models. The discovery proves how much room for improvement there still is for current models.

💡 **Angle**: Share thoughts on how this changes the AI landscape.
