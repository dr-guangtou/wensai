### [The Hydrostatic Mass Bias and the $\sigma_8$ Tension: A Multi-Probe Forecast for Stage-IV/V Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19478)

**Authors:** Ayodeji Ibitoye, Prabhakar Tiwari, Qi Xiong, Yan Gong
**Relevance Score:** 9.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Stage-IV CMB and optical surveys can calibrate the hydrostatic mass bias to percent-level precision (down to ~1%) through tomographic cross-correlations of thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (tSZ) signals, galaxy clustering, and weak lensing, effectively breaking the degeneracy with $\sigma_8$.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main Result:** Forecasted marginalized constraints on hydrostatic mass bias ($b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$) are **0.98%** for SO+LSST, **1.60%** for CMB-S4+LSST, and **2.40%** for CMB-S4+CSST.
- **Methodology:** Utilizes a Fisher forecast framework with optimized tomographic binning (10 lens/5 source bins for LSST; 6 lens/5 source bins for CSST) and full marginalization over cosmological and astrophysical nuisance parameters.
- **Tomographic Impact:** Tomographic analysis improves $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$ precision by a factor of approximately **three** relative to non-tomographic analyses; critically, optical-only probes provide **no direct constraint** on $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$ without the inclusion of tSZ spectra.
- **Broader Context:** The results indicate that multi-probe approaches can resolve the $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$--$\sigma_8$ degeneracy, a major systematic in cluster cosmology, allowing for robust constraints on structure growth.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Paper Type:** Theoretical (Fisher Forecast)

**Core Logic and Methods:**
- The study employs Fisher matrix forecasting to predict parameter constraints from Stage-IV surveys.
- It models the observables: thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, galaxy clustering, and weak lensing (cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing).
- The analysis incorporates realistic systematic effects, including foreground modeling for the clustered Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and radio sources, intrinsic alignments (IA), photometric redshift (photo-z) shifts, and baryonic feedback modeled via **HMCode2020**.
- It specifically investigates the breaking of the degeneracy between the hydrostatic mass bias ($b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$) and the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$) using redshift information.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Systematic Uncertainty:** The hydrostatic mass bias ($b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$) represents the difference between the hydrostatic equilibrium mass (derived from X-ray or tSZ pressure) and the true gravitational mass; it is the leading systematic uncertainty in cluster cosmology.
- **Degeneracy Problem:** $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$ is strongly degenerate with $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$, complicating the use of cluster counts to probe cosmology and potentially contributing to the "$\sigma_8$ tension" between CMB and low-redshift probes.
- **Multi-Probe Solution:** Cross-correlating tSZ maps (sensitive to baryonic pressure) with optical weak lensing (sensitive to total mass) and galaxy clustering provides a pathway to self-calibrate $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$ within the survey data itself, reducing reliance on external calibration.

### [Blue Monsters and Dusty Descendants: Reconciling UV and IR Emission from Galaxies from z=7, up to z= 14](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18556)

**Authors:** Laura Sommovigo, Lachlan Lancaster, Shyam H. Menon, Joseph A. O'Leary, Rachel S. Somerville, Greg L. Bryan
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Incorporating a porous, turbulent interstellar medium into galaxy evolution models resolves the tension between JWST's UV-bright galaxies at $z > 10$ and ALMA's dust-rich galaxies at $z \simeq 7$, though high redshifts may still require specific dust production or destruction mechanisms.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Resolution of UV-IR Tension:** A uniform ISM model creates a conflict where the UV luminosity function (LF) requires low dust yields ($y_d \lesssim 0.01\,M_\odot$) while the $z=7$ IR LF requires high yields ($y_d \sim 0.1\,M_\odot$); this is largely resolved by modeling a porous, turbulent ISM that allows UV escape through low-column-density sightlines while maintaining high total IR luminosity.
- **Methodology:** The study uses a minimal theoretical framework with only two free parameters—instantaneous star formation efficiency ($\epsilon_\star$) and dust yield per Type II supernova ($y_d$)—to predict UV and IR LFs from $z \simeq 14$ to $z \simeq 7$.
- **High-Redshift Constraint:** At $z > 10$, even strong turbulence cannot reproduce the bright end of the UV LF if dust yields are high, suggesting that early massive systems must experience efficient dust removal or that substantial ISM dust growth must occur by $z \simeq 7$.
- **Secondary Mechanisms:** The study finds that large-grain dust distributions play a secondary role in reducing UV opacity compared to the primary effects of ISM porosity and radiative transfer.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Type:** Theoretical Modeling

- **Core Logic:** The authors construct a model linking halo mass functions to luminosity functions via abundance matching. They compute stellar mass and star formation rates using $\epsilon_\star$, and dust mass using the SN dust yield $y_d$.
- **Radiative Transfer & ISM Structure:** The key advancement is the inclusion of a porous, turbulent ISM. Unlike uniform screens, turbulence creates a distribution of column densities. This "flattens" the attenuation curve, allowing a significant fraction of UV photons to escape (boosting the UV LF) without reducing the total energy absorbed and re-emmitted in the IR (preserving the IR LF).
- **Parameter Constraints:**
  - Uniform ISM requires $\epsilon_\star > 5\text{--}10\%$ to reconcile LFs with high dust yields.
  - Turbulent ISM allows for standard $\epsilon_\star$ and high yields ($y_d \sim 0.1\,M_\odot$) at $z=7$.
  - At $z > 10$, the model struggles to fit bright UV galaxies without invoking dust removal or growth mechanisms.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- No specific URLs, datasets, or software repositories were cited in the provided abstract.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Observational Tension:** There is a noted discrepancy between JWST observations of massive, UV-bright ("Blue Monsters"), apparently dust-free galaxies at $z > 10$ and ALMA detections of massive, dust-rich, IR-luminous galaxies at $z \simeq 7$.
- **The Core Question:** The central challenge is whether a single, unified physical model of star formation and dust production can simultaneously explain the UV and IR properties of galaxies across the epoch of reionization ($z \simeq 7\text{--}14$).
- **Dust Physics:** The introduction frames dust yield per supernova and star formation efficiency as the critical physical parameters governing the co-evolution of stellar populations and the interstellar medium in the early universe.

### [One Halo, Two Boundaries: Relating Accretion Shocks and Splashback Radii in Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18609)

**Authors:** Siddhant Sen, Susmita Adhikari, Daisuke Nagai, Benedikt Diemer
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Using IllustrisTNG simulations, this study reveals a persistent radial offset between gas accretion shocks and dark matter splashback radii in galaxy clusters ($R_{\rm sh}/R_{\rm sp} \sim 1.3-2$), challenging the theoretical expectation that these boundaries coincide.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
*   **Main Result:** The authors find a significant displacement between the splashback radius ($R_{\rm sp}$) and the accretion shock radius ($R_{\rm sh}$), with a ratio of $R_{\rm sh}/R_{\rm sp} \sim 1.3-2$. This offset is most pronounced along void directions.
*   **Methodology:** The study analyzed 812 cluster-mass halos from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite, computing the full angular distribution of both boundaries using a dispersion-based measure for the splashback boundary and maximum entropy distance for the shock location.
*   **Physical Mechanism:** The offset is driven by the distinct physical behavior of gas and dark matter during mergers: gas dissipates energy and resists contraction via pressure, whereas collisionless dark matter does not.
*   **Observational Implications:** The pressure profile feature associated with the outer accretion shock is highly sensitive to the specific method of stacking profiles, complicating the observational detection and characterization of these boundaries.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Simulation-based:**
*   **Simulations Used:** IllustrisTNG simulation suite.
*   **Physical Properties Studied:**
    *   **Splashback Radius ($R_{\rm sp}$):** Defined using a dispersion-based measure to capture the boundary of orbiting dark matter.
    *   **Accretion Shock Radius ($R_{\rm sh}$):** Defined via the maximum entropy distance to locate the thermalization boundary of gas.
    *   **Angular Distribution:** The study computed the full angular distribution of these radii rather than relying solely on spherically averaged profiles.
*   **Reproducibility:** The findings suggest that standard stacking methods may smear out shock features, a critical note for observers comparing against simulations.
*   **Key Simulation References:** IllustrisTNG project (Nelson et al. et seq.).

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
*   **Datasets:**
    *   IllustrisTNG Simulation Data: [https://www.tng-project.org/](https://www.tng-project.org/)
*   **Tools:**
    *   No specific software repositories or GitHub links were cited in the provided text.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*   **Halo Boundaries:** The splashback radius ($R_{\rm sp}$) delineates the boundary of dark matter halos, marking the apocenter of recently accreted material, while the accretion shock ($R_{\rm sh}$) marks the boundary where infalling gas is thermalized.
*   **Theoretical Expectation vs. Reality:** Standard theoretical models predict these two boundaries should coincide at the halo outskirts, but recent hydrodynamic simulations have shown significant displacement, prompting a need to understand the statistical relationship and physical drivers of this offset.
*   **Dynamics of Mergers:** The introduction highlights that during merger events, the collisionless nature of dark matter allows it to pass through and orbit, whereas gas experiences ram pressure and dissipative processes, leading to divergent boundary evolution.

### [The Optical Properties of Host Galaxies of Radio Sources in the Coma Cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19050)

**Authors:** Xiaolan Hou, Heng Yu, Tong Pan, Hu Zou, Haoran Dou, Emily Moravec, Chengkui Li
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
By combining deep LOFAR radio data with optical spectroscopy, this study finds that the radio morphology of Coma cluster galaxies—specifically compact, extended, or tailed shapes—directly correlates with their stellar mass, star formation activity, and infall position within the cluster environment.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Morphology-Host Connection:** Compact radio sources are hosted by massive, quiescent galaxies dominated by AGN activity, whereas tailed sources are predominantly hosted by star-forming galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping (RPS).
- **Environmental Mapping:** Using a projected infall time proxy ($d_R$), the authors map the cluster's influence: extended sources are found in the outskirts ($d_R > 1$), while tailed sources concentrate in the intermediate infall region ($0.4 < d_R < 1.0$), linking morphology to the density of the intracluster medium (ICM).
- **Sample Statistics:** The study identifies 79 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members with reliable radio emission within $1.35 R_{200}$ of the Coma cluster.
- **Verification Note:** The claim that tailed sources are "largely hosted by star-forming galaxies" is notable and somewhat counter-intuitive for classical "tailed radio galaxies" (usually AGN jets bent by the ICM); verification of the specific radio power and optical diagnostics for this subset is recommended to confirm if these are strictly RPS tails or bent AGN.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational Study:**
- **Methodology:** The authors cross-matched LoTSS-DR2 radio sources with DESI and SDSS optical catalogs. They utilized spectroscopic redshifts to confirm cluster membership and classified radio morphologies into three distinct groups (compact, extended, tailed). They employed phase-space analysis (projected radius vs. velocity) to estimate infall times.
- **Key Analysis:** Used the parameter $d_R$ (projected distance normalized by $R_{200}$) as a proxy for infall time to correlate radio morphology with dynamical state.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | 79 confirmed radio sources |
| Redshift range | Coma Cluster ($z \approx 0.023$) |
| Search Area | Within $1.35 R_{200}$ |
| Key instruments | LOFAR (144 MHz), DESI, SDSS |
| Data products | LoTSS-DR2, DESI spectroscopy/photometry |

- **SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey):** [https://www.sdss.org/](https://www.sdss.org/)

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Radio Sources as Environmental Probes:** Radio morphology in clusters is not static; it serves as a tracer for the interaction between the host galaxy and the dense ICM, specifically highlighting mechanisms like ram pressure stripping.
- **Dichotomy of Radio Emission:** The introduction likely contrasts the origins of radio emission—AGN activity dominant in massive/quiescent galaxies versus star formation or RPS in gas-rich galaxies—and how the cluster environment quenches or alters these mechanisms.
- **Phase-Space Analysis:** The use of position-velocity phase-space diagrams is established as a robust method for estimating the accretion history and "infall time" of cluster galaxies, moving beyond simple projected distance analyses.

### [Feedback shaped the galaxy morphological sequence in presence of mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19227)

**Authors:** Masafumi Noguchi
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The paper demonstrates that the observed peak in galaxy mass fraction at a halo mass of $\sim 10^{12} {\rm M}_\odot$—driven by stellar and AGN feedback—dictates the galaxy morphological sequence by regulating the efficiency of bulge growth during mergers.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main Result:** The morphological sequence (increasing bulge-to-disk ratio with galaxy mass) arises because massive halos ($> 10^{12} {\rm M}_\odot$) predominantly merge with satellites having higher galaxy mass fractions, efficiently building bulges, whereas low-mass halos merge with satellites having lower fractions, inhibiting bulge growth.
- **Methodology:** The study employs a simple galaxy evolution model incorporating halo mergers and the observed stellar mass–halo mass relation (specifically the peak in galaxy mass fraction).
- **Unexpected Result:** The study establishes a causal link between feedback processes (traditionally associated with star formation quenching) and morphological transformation, suggesting feedback is the root cause of the morphology–mass relation.
- **Connection to Broader Field:** This work unifies two previously distinct areas of galaxy evolution—feedback mechanisms and morphological transformation—implying that the physics regulating star formation efficiency simultaneously dictates structural evolution.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper Type:** Theoretical

- **Core Logic and Methods:** The author uses an analytical/semi-analytical approach to track the evolution of galaxy mass fractions and bulge growth during halo mergers. The model relies on the premise that the galaxy mass fraction ($f_{\rm gal}$) is not monotonic with halo mass but peaks at $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12} {\rm M}_\odot$.
- **Theoretical Picture:**
    - **High-mass halos:** Host galaxies have lower $f_{\rm gal}$ than their satellites (which are typically lower mass and closer to the peak efficiency). Mergers deposit relatively large amounts of stellar/gas mass into the host, increasing the bulge-to-total ratio.
    - **Low-mass halos:** Host galaxies have higher $f_{\rm gal}$ than their satellites. Mergers deposit relatively small amounts of galaxy mass compared to the dark matter, failing to significantly grow the bulge relative to the disk.
- **Feedback Connection:** The model attributes the existence of the $f_{\rm gal}$ peak at $10^{12} {\rm M}_\odot$ to supernova (SN) feedback suppressing star formation in low-mass halos and AGN feedback suppressing it in high-mass halos.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- No specific datasets, software repositories, or external databases were cited in the provided abstract. The study relies on established observational trends (the stellar mass–halo mass relation) and theoretical modeling.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Morphological Sequence:** The ratio of bulge-to-disk mass statistically increases with galaxy mass, culminating in elliptical galaxies at the high-mass end, though the origin of this sequence remains incompletely understood.
- **Bulge Formation via Mergers:** Galaxy mergers (accompanying dark matter halo mergers) are the leading theoretical mechanism for bulge formation.
- **Stellar Mass–Halo Mass Relation:** Observations establish that the fraction of baryons locked in stars and cold gas (galaxy mass fraction) peaks at a halo mass of $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12} {\rm M}_\odot$ across cosmic time.

### [The major merger-active galactic nucleus connection up to the cosmic noon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19997)

**Authors:** A. La Marca, B. Margalef-Bentabol, L. Wang, S. C. Trager, V. Rodriguez-Gomez, G. Martin
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
This study demonstrates that major mergers trigger Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) out to $z\sim2$, with the connection strengthening significantly for the most luminous AGN where merger fractions exceed 50%.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main result:** AGN are moderately more frequent in merging galaxies than non-mergers, with excess ratios ranging from $\sim2.5$ (X-ray AGN) to $\sim1.1$–$1.2$ (SED-selected AGN); crucially, the merger fraction ($f_{merg}$) increases monotonically with AGN luminosity ($L_{disc}$), exceeding 50% for the most powerful AGN ($L_{disc} \gtrsim 10^{46}\,{erg\,s^{-1}}$).
- **Methodology highlight:** Utilized a stellar mass-limited sample in the COSMOS field at $z=0.5$–$2$, employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on mock JWST observations to identify mergers, alongside three independent AGN selection methods (MIR, X-ray, SED).
- **Unexpected result:** The relationship between merger fraction and AGN dominance ($f_{AGN}$) reveals two distinct regimes: $f_{merg}$ remains flat for less-dominant AGN ($f_{AGN}<0.8$) but rises sharply for highly dominant AGN ($f_{AGN}>0.8$).
- **Broader context:** Resolves previous ambiguities regarding the merger-AGN connection at "cosmic noon," establishing that while other mechanisms may fuel lower-luminosity AGN, major mergers are the principal triggering mechanism for the most powerful systems at these epochs.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational Study:**
- The study constructs a stellar mass-limited sample to ensure completeness. It identifies AGN through a multi-wavelength approach: mid-infrared (MIR) colors, X-ray detections, and SED fitting. Mergers are identified via CNNs applied to JWST imaging. To isolate the physical effects of mergers and AGN activity from confounding variables (like mass and redshift), the authors create control samples matched in redshift, stellar mass, and star-formation rate (SFR).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | Stellar mass-limited (N not specified in abstract) |
| Redshift range | $z = 0.5 - 2$ |
| Key instruments | JWST, X-ray observatories, MIR instruments |
| Data products | COSMOS multi-wavelength dataset |
| Citation to note | COSMOS survey references |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **Datasets:** COSMOS field multi-wavelength datasets; JWST observations.
- **Tools:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for visual merger identification.
- **Note:** No specific URLs or GitHub repositories were provided in the abstract.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*(Note: Points inferred from the context provided in the abstract.)*
- The role of major mergers in triggering AGN is well-established locally but remains highly debated beyond the local Universe, particularly at $z > 0.5$.
- Previous studies lacked the high-resolution imaging or robust control samples necessary to definitively isolate the merger signature from general galaxy evolution at "cosmic noon."
- A key open question is whether the merger-AGN connection depends on AGN luminosity or dominance, which this study addresses by parameterizing AGN power via accretion disc luminosity ($L_{disc}$) and AGN fraction ($f_{AGN}$).

### [Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 5. Cosmological Constraints with Simulation-Based Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18554)

**Authors:** Anton Chudaykin, Mikhail M. Ivanov, Oliver H. E. Philcox
**Relevance Score:** 8.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Incorporating simulation-based priors derived from halo occupation distribution models into the analysis of DESI DR1 full-shape clustering data tightens cosmological constraints by up to 50% and yields the strongest upper limit on neutrino mass to date, while finding no statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
*   **Tightened $\Lambda$CDM Constraints:** Combining simulation-based priors (SBPs) with DESI DR1 power spectra and DR2 BAO data yields $\Omega_m=0.2987\pm 0.0066$, $H_0=68.80\pm 0.35\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.766\pm 0.015$. These represent 1%, 40%, and 50% improvements over baseline constraints, respectively, though the authors note a downward shift in $\sigma_8$.
*   **Neutrino Mass Limits:** The analysis sets a 95% confidence upper limit on the total neutrino mass of $M_\nu < 0.090\,\mathrm{eV}$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, reported as the strongest constraint to date, reinforcing the preference for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy.
*   **Dark Energy Dynamics:** The study finds no significant evidence for dynamical dark energy; the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) within $2.2\sigma$ (without supernovae) and $1.4\sigma$ (with supernovae).
*   **Methodological Impact:** The inclusion of SBPs significantly improves the Dark Energy Figure-of-Merit by 70% (with CMB) and 20% (with CMB and supernovae) in $w_0w_a$CDM analyses, demonstrating that small-scale information can be robustly leveraged to sharpen cosmological constraints.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper Type:** Theoretical / Methodological (Reanalysis of Observational Data)

**Methodology Summary:**
The authors reanalyze public DESI DR1 full-shape power spectrum data using Effective Field Theory (EFT). The key innovation is the use of Simulation-Based Priors (SBPs) for the EFT nuisance parameters (biases and counterterms). Instead of wide, uninformative priors, they generate field-level simulations using tailored Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) models for specific DESI tracers. They fit normalizing flows to the resulting distribution of EFT parameters to create informative, physically motivated priors.

**Quick Reference Table:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Data Release | DESI DR1 (Full-Shape) + DESI DR2 (BAO) |
| Key Tracers | DESI LRGs, ELGs, QSOs (implied from "each tracer") |
| Simulation Method | Field-level simulations with tailored HOD models |
| Prior Technique | Normalizing Flows fitted to EFT parameters |
| External Data | BBN prior, CMB, Supernovae (for extended models) |
| Key Result Caveat | Results are sensitive to HOD modeling assumptions |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
*   **Datasets:**
    *   DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) full-shape clustering data.
    *   DESI Data Release 2 (DR2) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data.
*   **Tools/Software:**
    *   Normalizing Flows (for density estimation of priors).
    *   Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) models.
    *   *Note: Specific GitHub repositories or code URLs were not provided in the abstract.*

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*   **Small-Scale Information:** Standard analyses often discard or marginalize over small-scale information due to modeling uncertainties; this work argues that small-scale modes can be recovered by constraining EFT parameters with physically motivated simulation priors.
*   **EFT Priors:** Traditional EFT analyses use wide flat priors on bias and counterterm parameters to avoid model misspecification, which comes at the cost of increased statistical uncertainty; SBPs offer a middle ground by restricting parameters to physically plausible regions derived from HOD models.
*   **Current Tensions:** The introduction likely contextualizes the analysis within current cosmological tensions (e.g., $S_8$ tension, dynamical dark energy hints from previous DESI releases), positioning this methodology as a rigorous test of these anomalies.

### [The ionised interstellar medium of DSFGs revealed by JWST/NIRSpec and ALMA: Super-solar metallicity, low ionisation parameters and, typical electron densities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18558)

**Authors:** Steven Gillman (DAWN, DTU-Space), Kei Ito, Francesco Valentino, Gabe Brammer, Pablo Araya Araya, Georgios Magdis, Ugn\.e Dudzevi\v{c}i\=ut\.e, et al. (28 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.5/10

We present a detailed study of near-infrared (2-4$\rm \mu$m) JWST/NIRSpec spectra of 48 high-redshift ($z=2.53^{+1.32}_{-0.70}$) galaxies detected with ALMA at $>3\sigma$. From a multi-wavelength SED analysis we establish the sample has a a median stellar mass of $\rm\log_{10}(M_\ast/M_\odot)=10.8\pm0.1$ and dust mass of $\rm\log_{10}(M_{\rm d}/M_\odot)=8.7\pm0.1$, covering a broad range of far-infrared luminosity $\rm (\log_{10}(L_{FIR}/L_\odot)=10.9-12.7)$. The majority of sources show no signs of AGN activity, with 40% having either X-ray counterparts $(\rm L_{Xc}>10^{42}erg/s)$, elevated optical line ratios, or broad (FWHM>800 km/s) H$\alpha$ profiles, although we note this is a lower limit due to the stochastic placement of NIRSpec slits. We establish the sample has a median gas-phase metallicity of $12+\log({\rm O/H})=8.71\pm0.02$, as derived from the [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratio, with the most FIR-luminous galaxies ($\rm\log_{10}(L_{\rm FIR}/L_\odot)>12$) falling $0.15\pm0.03$dex above the fundamental metallicity relation. From the [SII] emission-line doublet ratio, we measure a median electron density of $\log_{10}(n_{\rm e}/{\rm cm}^{-3})=2.53\pm0.07$ consistent with less-massive, star-forming, galaxies at the same epoch. For nine galaxies with [OII] and H$\beta$ detections (median $\rm\log_{10}(L_{\rm FIR}/L_\odot)=11.81\pm0.15$), we derive a median observed (dust-uncorrected) ionisation parameter of $\rm\log_{10}(U)=-2.84\pm0.06$. Our results indicate that luminous far-infrared galaxies are massive, chemically evolved systems that appear to deviate from the standard dust and metal production equilibrium observed in less obscured galaxies. This study demonstrates the synergy of JWST and ALMA in unveiling the nature of DSFGs, and highlights the need for a NIRSpec survey of uniformly selected, massive, dust-obscured, galaxies to fully characterise their interstellar medium.

### [Cosmological constraints from a joint DESI DR1 Full-Shape and DR2 BAO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18761)

**Authors:** D. Forero-S\'anchez, H. Gil-Mar\'in, L. Verde, Z. Ding, A. J. Ross, A. Carnero Rosell, J. Aguilar, S. Ahlen, et al. (64 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
By combining DESI DR1 Full-Shape and DR2 BAO data using the ShapeFit compression method to mitigate prior volume effects, this work presents the first robust, DESI-only constraints on dynamical dark energy, finding results consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Cosmological Parameters (Flat $\Lambda$CDM):** The analysis yields $\Omega_m = 0.3035 \pm 0.0085$, $h = 0.6876 \pm 0.0059$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.822 \pm 0.034$ using only DESI data combined with BBN priors.
- **Dynamical Dark Energy ($w_0 w_a$CDM):** The study measures $w_0 = 0.49 \pm 0.25$ and $w_a = -1.52 \pm 0.77$, improving constraints by $\sim 30\%$ over DR1-only results and reducing the tension with $\Lambda$CDM to $1.4\sigma$ (compared to higher tensions seen in BAO-only analyses).
- **Methodological Advance:** The use of ShapeFit compression successfully mitigates prior volume effects, allowing for reliable Bayesian constraints on extensions to $\Lambda$CDM without relying on strong external priors (e.g., CMB).
- **Broader Context:** The reduction in tension suggests that the previous hints of evolving dark energy from DESI BAO-only analyses may be partially attributed to statistical fluctuations or systematic handling, though the current results still allow for significant deviation from the cosmological constant.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational Analysis:**
- **Methodology:** The paper employs the **ShapeFit** compression method to combine Full-Shape (FS) clustering measurements from DR1 with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DR2. This approach compresses the power spectrum shape into a set of parameters that are less susceptible to prior volume effects.
- **Covariance:** A joint covariance matrix is estimated using **EZmocks** to account for the correlation between DR1 and DR2 data releases.
- **Priors:** The analysis uses a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) prior on the baryon density and a wide prior on the spectral index $n_s$, avoiding strong CMB priors to maintain independence.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **Datasets:**
    - DESI Data Release 1 (DR1)
    - DESI Data Release 2 (DR2)
- **Tools/Software:**
    - ShapeFit (compression method)
    - EZmocks (mock catalog generator for covariance estimation)

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Prior Volume Effects:** Standard Bayesian analyses of Full-Shape galaxy clustering with minimal external priors suffer from "prior volume effects," where the choice of prior artificially influences the posterior, particularly for parameters like $w_0$ and $w_a$. This has previously prevented reliable DESI-only constraints on beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models.
- **Data Combination Challenges:** Combining data from different releases (DR1 and DR2) requires careful estimation of the joint covariance matrix because the datasets are not independent; the overlap and correlation structure must be modeled (here, via EZmocks) to avoid double-counting or underestimating errors.
- **ShapeFit Utility:** The ShapeFit method compresses the broadband shape of the power spectrum into "shape parameters" (related to the physical matter density and spectral index) that are robust against systematic shifts, enabling a cleaner extraction of cosmological information compared to traditional full-model fitting in cases with wide priors.

Automated characterization of galactic substructure is an essential step in understanding the transformative physical processes driving galaxy evolution. In this study, we investigate the application of deep learning (DL) frameworks to characterize different galactic substructures hosted within parametric light-profile subtracted ``residual'' images of a large sample galaxies from the CANDELS survey. We develop a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and unsupervised Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CvAE) and train it on the single-S\'ersic profile fitting based residual images of $10,046$ bright and massive galaxies ($H<24.5\,{\rm mag}$ and $M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$) spanning $1<3$, in conjunction with their visual-based classification labels indicating the nature of residual substructures hosted within them. Using our unique data preprocessing approach, we prepare our residual images such that the inputs to our DL networks comprise only ``galaxy of interest'', and augment them such that our sample span uniformly across different residual characteristics. We assess the latent space of the CNN and CvAE using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) along with independently quantified metrics of residual strength (significant pixel flux $SPF$, Bumpiness, and Residual Flux Fraction). We also employ an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) based clustering scheme with Support Vector Classification (SVC) to identify groupings in PCA space that correspond to similar residual substructure. We find that our supervised CNN latent features in PCA space correlate with the $SPF$ values and distinguish between qualitatively strong and weak residual substructures. While our unsupervised CvAE latent space also correlates with visual and quantitative residual characteristics, but lacks clear discriminatory power when characterizing different residual substructures.

### [Bar Formation During a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like Merger Event](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19995)

**Authors:** Bin-Hui Chen, Juntai Shen, Paola Di Matteo
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
This study uses N-body simulations to demonstrate that the survival of a forming galactic bar during a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus-like merger is primarily determined by the mass ratio of the satellite, where mergers with $m/M \gtrsim 1/2$ destroy the bar while minor mergers ($m/M \lesssim 1/10$) generally allow it to survive.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Mass Ratio Dominance:** The satellite-to-central galaxy mass ratio ($m/M$) is the primary determinant of bar survival. Mergers with $m/M \lesssim 1/10$ preserve the bar, while those with $m/M \geq 1/2$ destroy it, resulting in early-type-like remnants.
- **Intermediate Mass Regime:** Models with intermediate mass ratios ($1/5 \leq m/M \leq 1/3$) produce "weakening bars" that survive the initial merger but decay during secular evolution, potentially due to interactions between nested double bars formed from merger debris.
- **Secondary Parameters:** The impact parameter ($b$) and orbital inclination ($\theta_i$) have only secondary, stochastic effects on bar survival compared to the mass ratio.
- **Destruction Mechanism:** Bar destruction is attributed to the tidal force of the satellite crossing the bar nearly perpendicular to its major axis, effectively weakening the structure.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Simulation-based:**
- **Simulations used:** A suite of N-body merger simulations.
- **Setup:** A fixed central disk galaxy is merged with a "Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE)-like" satellite galaxy modeled as a radially biased disk.
- **Parameter Space:** The study explores three key merger parameters: mass ratio ($m/M$), impact parameter ($b$), and orbital inclination angle ($\theta_i$).
- **Key Simulation References:** The satellite model is designed to mimic the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus progenitor (radially biased).

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- No specific datasets, URLs, or software repositories were cited in the provided abstract.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Bar Formation Mechanisms:** Bars can form internally via dynamical instabilities or externally via galaxy interactions; however, the specific impact of mergers on bar survival remains under-investigated.
- **Merger Impact:** While interactions can trigger bar formation, major mergers are often considered destructive to disks and their substructures; this work bridges the gap by examining bar evolution during the merger process itself.
- **GSE Context:** The Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus event is a significant radially biased merger in the Milky Way's history, serving as a physical motivation for the satellite parameters used in the simulations.

**Authors:** Anna Velichko, Yves Revaz, Annalisa De Cia, C\'edric Ledoux, Jens-Kristian Krogager, C\'eline P\'eroux, Benedetta Casavecchia
**Relevance Score:** 6.5/10

• **Main Question:** This study investigates how the chemical and dynamical properties of quasar-damped Lyman-α (DLA) galaxies compare with cosmological simulations to constrain relationships between metallicity, alpha-element enhancements, stellar mass, and star formation rates.

• **Methodology:** The authors compare observational data with five galaxies simulated using the GEAR chemodynamical Tree-SPH code, covering stellar masses of $\log(M_*/M_\odot) \approx 6.1 - 10.8$ across redshifts $z \approx 0.33 - 4.12$.

• **Key Result:** The analysis reveals that DLA velocity widths ($\Delta v_{90}$) effectively trace galaxy mass, where values below 100 km/s correspond to low-mass galaxies ($\log M_* \sim 6-8$) and values above 100 km/s trace higher-mass systems ($\log M_* \sim 8-11$).

• **Significance:** While the simulations successfully reproduce observed abundance ratios and mass-metallicity relations, the results highlight systematic biases in using emission-line observations to constrain [$\alpha$/Fe] versus specific star formation rate relations.

### [Variational views for self-supervised learning in radio astronomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18923)

**Authors:** Johnny Joseph Alphonse, Anna M. M. Scaife
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

• **Problem:** Traditional supervised learning struggles with the massive, unlabelled datasets from modern radio surveys, while standard self-supervised learning (SSL) augmentations often fail to capture nuanced morphological variations in radio galaxies.

• **Methodology:** The authors propose a coupled approach where a pre-trained $\beta$-Variational Autoencoder (VAE) generates "views" to augment the training of a larger view-based SSL model.

• **Key Results:** A $\beta$-VAE with moderate regularization ($\beta=2.3$) successfully disentangled morphological features, revealing that Fanaroff-Riley class identity manifests as a continuous transition in latent space; integrating these generative views with standard augmentations improved downstream classification performance.

• **Significance:** This work demonstrates that generative and contrastive learning approaches are complementary, establishing disentanglement-aware self-supervised learning as a promising direction for future radio astronomy surveys.
