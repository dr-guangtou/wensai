### [Intracluster Medium Fluctuations on Scales up to 1 Mpc: A Combined eROSITA and SPT/Planck Analysis of Abell 3266](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21443)

**Authors:** H. Saxena, A. Heinrich, J. Sayers, I. Zhuravleva, E. Bulbul, J. Sanders, C. Avestruz, R. Basu Thakur, et al. (25 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
By combining eROSITA X-ray and SPT/Planck SZ observations of the merging cluster Abell 3266, this study measures intracluster medium fluctuations to derive a non-thermal pressure support of ~7% and identifies spatially asymmetric density perturbations indicative of ongoing filamentary accretion.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
*   **Main Result:** The study measures the ratio of pressure-to-density fluctuation amplitudes as $1.00 \pm 0.55$ and estimates the non-thermal pressure support fraction to be $0.068 \pm 0.050$.
*   **Methodology Highlight:** This is a joint analysis of deep SRG-eROSITA (X-ray) and Planck/SPT (Sunyaev-Zel'dovich) data, used to derive power spectra and deprojected 3D amplitudes of ICM perturbations.
*   **Unexpected/Surprising Result:** Density fluctuations are significantly stronger in the northern sector of the cluster compared to the south, which correlates with an accretion filament detected by eROSITA.
*   **Connection to Broader Field:** The finding that density fluctuation amplitudes increase with radius qualitatively matches predictions from cosmological simulations, providing observational validation for models of cluster assembly.
*   **Limitation Noted:** The authors explicitly state that uncertainties are dominated by the low sensitivity of current Planck/SPT data, highlighting the need for higher-resolution SZ observations to tighten constraints on ICM energy transport.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational Analysis:**
*   **Target:** Abell 3266 (A3266), a dynamically complex, merging galaxy cluster with elongated morphology.
*   **Observables:** X-ray surface brightness (tracing density) and SZ Compton-$y$ parameter (tracing pressure).
*   **Methodology:** The authors measured 2D power spectra of fluctuations, performed deprojection to obtain 3D fluctuation amplitudes, and used the ratio of these amplitudes to constrain the effective Equation of State (EOS) and non-thermal pressure.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*   **ICM Turbulence Sources:** Turbulence and perturbations in the intracluster medium (ICM) are generated by hierarchical mergers, AGN feedback, and filamentary accretion.
*   **Diagnostic Potential:** Measuring density and pressure inhomogeneities allows for constraints on the effective Equation of State (EOS) of perturbations and ICM velocities, offering a way to quantify the energy injection and dissipation processes in clusters.
*   **Current Limitations:** While X-ray data provides high sensitivity for density fluctuations, current SZ data quality (sensitivity/resolution) limits the precision of pressure fluctuation measurements, which is the dominant source of error in joint analyses.

**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Using deep, metallicity-sensitive CaHK narrowband photometry from the DECam MAGIC survey, this study identifies stellar tidal tails extending at least 95 kpc from the Crater II dwarf galaxy, confirming significant tidal disruption and revealing a previously undetected metallicity gradient.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Tidal Tails & Mass Loss:** The study identifies 37 candidate member stars in tidal tails extending $\geq 7^\circ$ ($\sim 95$ kpc) from the galaxy center, implying Crater II has lost $\gtrsim 25\%$ of its initial stellar mass.
- **Metallicity Gradient:** The authors report the first detection of a metallicity gradient in Crater II’s center ($-0.34 \pm 0.17$ dex deg$^{-1}$), a key diagnostic for understanding its internal evolution and disruption history.
- **Methodological Achievement:** The combination of CaHK photometry with Gaia proper motions allows for the detection of extremely low surface brightness features ($\sim 36$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$) with low contamination, demonstrating the power of narrowband surveys for faint stellar halo archaeology.
- **Dark Matter Profile:** Comparison with $N$-body models indicates that Crater II's density profile remains ambiguous regarding whether it inhabits a "cored" or "cuspy" dark matter halo, warranting further dynamic modeling.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational Paper**

**Methodology:**
The authors utilize metallicity-sensitive narrowband photometry centered on the Ca II H and K lines (CaHK) from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to separate Crater II's metal-poor red giant branch (RGB) stars from foreground Milky Way dwarfs. This photometric selection is combined with *Gaia* proper motion and parallax cuts to purify the sample of 162 candidate members across a $128$ deg$^2$ footprint.

| Sample size | 162 candidates (37 in tails) |
| Sky coverage | 128 deg$^2$ |
| Key instruments | DECam (Blanco 4m), *Gaia* |
| Surface brightness limit | $\sim 36$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ |
| Stream width | $w \sim 0.8^\circ$ ($\sim 50\%$ larger than half-light radius) |

### [Galaxy and black hole coevolution in dark matter haloes not captured by cosmological simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21298)

**Authors:** Hassen M. Yesuf, Connor Bottrell
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
A comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs reveals that current cosmological simulations (SIMBA, TNG, EAGLE) fail to reproduce the observed relationships between star formation, AGN activity, and halo mass, largely due to incorrect quenching prescriptions for satellites and central galaxies.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main Result:** All three simulations (SIMBA, TNG, EAGLE) overproduce quenched low-mass satellite galaxies in massive halos and misrepresent quenched fractions of massive centrals and galaxies in low-density environments.
- **Methodology:** The study uses a benchmark sample of ~60,000 AGNs and ~500,000 total galaxies at $z < 0.15$ with new environment and halo-mass measurements to perform unified comparisons with cosmological simulations.
- **Unexpected Result:** While simulations qualitatively capture the higher frequency of AGNs in low-mass halos compared to clusters, the detailed demographics of host galaxies diverge strongly from observations, failing to link star formation, quiescence, and AGN luminosity correctly.
- **Broader Connection:** The results highlight critical deficiencies in current feedback implementations and multi-phase gas modeling, suggesting that simulations do not yet accurately capture the coevolution of black holes, galaxies, and halos.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Paper Type:** Observational study with simulation comparison.

**Methodology Summary:**
The authors derive new environment and halo-mass measurements for a large sample of local galaxies. They compare the observed distributions of star formation, quiescence, and AGN luminosity as functions of stellar mass and halo mass against mock observations generated from the SIMBA, IllustrisTNG (TNG), and EAGLE simulations.

**Observational Data Reference Table:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | ~500,000 galaxies (including ~60,000 AGNs) |
| Redshift range | $z < 0.15$ |
| Key instruments | Not specified in abstract (likely SDSS based on sample size/depth) |
| Data products | Halo masses, environment metrics, AGN luminosities, stellar masses |
| Simulation comparison | SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, EAGLE |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
*   **Simulations:** SIMBA, IllustrisTNG (TNG), EAGLE.
*   *Note: The abstract does not provide specific URLs or software repositories.*

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*   **Contextual Problem:** The relative importance of internal processes (e.g., AGN feedback) versus environmental processes (e.g., ram pressure stripping) in governing star formation remains a major open question.
*   **Observational Gaps:** Uncertainties in measuring AGN host galaxy properties and limitations in current modeling obscure the true impact of supermassive black hole feedback across different environments and cosmic time.
*   **Simulation Tension:** There is a need for unified, "apples-to-apples" comparisons between observations and simulations to validate the physical prescriptions used for black hole feedback and gas cooling.

### [Impact and interplay of $\Lambda$CDM analysis choices for LSST cosmic shear](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21863)

**Authors:** N. C. Robertson (for The FLAMINGO team, The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration), C. Heymans (for The FLAMINGO team, The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration), J. Zuntz (for The FLAMINGO team, The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration), P. Burger (for The FLAMINGO team, The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration), et al. (24 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Current uncertainties in baryon feedback and photometric redshift calibration could cause LSST Year 10 cosmic shear constraints on $S_8$ to show negligible improvement over Year 1 results unless specific methodological advancements are made.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Impact of Baryons:** Accounting for current uncertainties in the suppression of the non-linear matter power spectrum due to baryon feedback nearly doubles the error on the cosmological parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ compared to analyses that neglect this effect.
- **Photo-z Bottleneck:** Because LSST Year 1 extends beyond the magnitude limits of existing spectroscopic calibration samples, the study forecasts that relying on current cross-correlation calibration techniques combined with baryonic uncertainties results in Year 10 constraints that barely improve upon Year 1.
- **Potential vs. Reality:** With tight priors on systematics, LSST cosmic shear could constrain $S_8$ more than five times better than existing surveys; however, realizing this potential requires urgent work to constrain baryon feedback and calibrate photometric redshifts at depths where spectroscopy is unavailable.
- **Methodology:** The analysis uses a forecasting framework designed to accurately recover the $\Lambda$CDM model in the presence of astrophysical and data-related systematics for the Rubin Observatory LSST.

#### 3. KEY TECHTICAL DETAILS
**Paper Type:** Simulation-based / Forecasting

**Methodology & Simulations:**
- The study utilizes the **FLAMINGO** simulation suite to model the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power spectrum.
- It constructs a forecasting framework for LSST cosmic shear (Years 1 and 10) that integrates astrophysical systematics (baryon feedback) and observational systematics (photometric redshift uncertainties).
- The analysis specifically models the "depth gap" where LSST photometric sources are fainter than available spectroscopic training sets, testing calibration via galaxy cross-correlation techniques based on literature precision.

**Key Simulation References:**
- FLAMINGO simulations (Schaye et al., Kugel et al. - *inferred from collaboration attribution*).

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
*Note: Specific URLs were not provided in the abstract text, but the following key resources are referenced:*
- **Simulations:** The FLAMINGO simulation suite.
- **Survey Data:** Forecasts for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
- **Calibration References:** Literature measurements of reduced redshift calibration precision from galaxy cross-correlation techniques.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **The Systematics Floor:** The abstract highlights a shift in the field where statistical errors are decreasing so rapidly (with LSST) that astrophysical systematics—specifically baryonic feedback suppression of the matter power spectrum—have become a dominant source of error, potentially doubling the uncertainty on $S_8$.
- **The Calibration Depth Gap:** A critical challenge for next-generation surveys is the "depth gap": LSST Y1 data immediately surpasses the magnitude limits of representative spectroscopic samples, forcing a reliance on less precise cross-correlation techniques for redshift calibration.
- **Stagnation Risk:** There is a tangible risk that LSST may fail to improve cosmological constraints between its first and final years of operation if the community does not develop new methods to constrain baryon models and improve photo-z calibration for deep, unrepresentative samples.

### [Probing Large-scale Structure and the Multi-Phase IGM at the Cosmic Noon -- Insights from a Joint Survey with Euclid, CSST, JPCam, and JUST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22004)

**Authors:** Jiang-Tao Li, Renato A. Dupke, Yan Gong, Zhijie Qu, Weichen Wang, Xiaohu Yang, Xiaodi Yu
**Relevance Score:** 8.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
A proposed multi-facility survey of the Euclid Deep Field North demonstrates that combining Euclid, CSST, and JPCam data significantly improves photometric redshifts and enables detection of extended CGM halos, though simulations reveal that mapping diffuse IGM metallicity with JUST is currently infeasible and requires future 39m-class telescopes.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Photo-z Improvement:** The addition of JPCam's J-PAS-like narrow-band system to Euclid/CSST broad-band data substantially improves photometric redshift accuracy, particularly for star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.0$–$1.4$, enabling the direct identification of galaxy groups and (proto-)clusters.
- **CGM Detection:** Stacked JPCam narrow-band imaging is predicted to detect extended [O II]-emitting CGM halos, offering a way to probe the gas surrounding galaxies directly.
- **IGM Mapping Success:** Mock observations show that the reconstructed 3D H I field from CSST Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra reliably recovers large-scale structures at the cosmic noon.
- **IGM Metallicity Limitation:** The study finds that detecting diffuse IGM Mg II absorption with the JUST telescope is infeasible via spectral stacking or two-point correlation functions; constraining diffuse IGM metallicity will require the sensitivity and resolution of future facilities like the 39 m E-ELT.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper Type:** Survey Design & Simulation Forecast

**Methodology:**
The paper presents scientific justifications for a coordinated survey of the Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N). It utilizes mock 3D gas distribution models and realistic galaxy catalogs to simulate observations. The authors simulate CSST and JUST background galaxy spectra, injecting Ly$\alpha$ and Mg II absorption signals to test recovery methods. They also model the impact of combining broad-band (Euclid/CSST) and narrow-band (JPCam) photometry on photo-z precision.

**Survey & Simulation Parameters:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Survey Area | $\sim$20 deg$^2$ (EDF-N) |
| Target Epoch | Cosmic Noon ($z \sim 1$–$3$) |
| Key Redshift Range (Photo-z) | $z \sim 1.0$–$1.4$ (star-forming galaxies) |
| Facilities | Euclid, CSST, JPCam, JUST |
| Simulation Products | Mock galaxy catalogs, 3D gas distribution, Mock spectra (Ly$\alpha$, Mg II) |
| Key Forecast Limit | JUST unable to detect diffuse IGM Mg II |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
*   **Survey Field:** Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N)
*   **Systems Referenced:** J-PAS-like narrow-band filter system (used in JPCam simulations)
*   *Note: The paper is a forecast/proposal; it relies on simulated mock catalogs rather than public archival datasets.*

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
-   **The Galactic Ecosystem:** The paper frames the "galactic ecosystem" as the critical connection between galaxies and their circumgalactic (CGM) and intergalactic (IGM) environments, emphasizing that understanding galaxy evolution requires mapping gas flows and feedback mechanisms.
-   **The Cosmic Noon:** This epoch ($z \sim 1$–$3$) is highlighted as the peak of star formation and black hole activity, making it the primary target for understanding how galaxies assembled and how the CGM/IGM evolved.
-   **Survey Synergies:** The introduction argues that single-facility surveys are insufficient; a coordinated approach combining deep broad-band imaging (for morphology/flux), narrow-band imaging (for redshifts/emission lines), and spectroscopy (for absorption) is required to fully characterize the multi-phase IGM.

### [Bulk and turbulent gas motions in the interacting galaxy cluster Abell 3395 South observed with XRISM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21580)

**Authors:** Naomi Ota, Angie Veronica, Jakob Dietl, Anri Yanagawa, Thomas H. Reiprich, Veronica Biffi, Klaus Dolag, Marcus Br\"uggen, et al. (11 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
XRISM observations of the interacting galaxy cluster Abell 3395 South reveal a significant line-of-sight bulk velocity of $263\pm23~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ coexisting with low turbulence ($124\pm21~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$), indicating an unrelaxed dynamical state where turbulent reacceleration is insufficient to generate a radio halo.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main result:** The study reports a direct detection of line-of-sight bulk motion ($263\pm23~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) alongside low one-dimensional turbulent velocity ($124\pm21~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) in the intracluster medium (ICM) of A3395S.
- **Methodology highlight:** Utilized high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy from the XRISM/Resolve instrument, specifically analyzing the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ emission line to measure gas kinematics.
- **Unexpected or surprising result:** The finding of low turbulence despite significant bulk motion and ongoing interaction suggests that the specific dynamical configuration of A3395S has not efficiently converted bulk kinetic energy into turbulent motions within the core.
- **Connection to broader field:** The low turbulence provides a physical explanation for the non-detection of a radio halo in this system, supporting models where turbulent reacceleration requires higher turbulent energy densities than those observed here.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational Study:**
- The study focuses on the core region of the Abell 3395 South subcluster.
- Key observables include the line-of-sight velocity (bulk motion) and line broadening (turbulent velocity) derived from the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line complex.
- The analysis interprets the kinematic measurements in the context of the cluster's merger status and multi-wavelength properties (specifically radio non-detections).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Target | Abell 3395 South (A3395S) |
| Key instruments | XRISM (X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission), Resolve microcalorimeter |
| Emission Line Analyzed | Fe XXV He$\alpha$ |
| 1D Turbulent Velocity ($v_{\rm turb}$) | $124 \pm 21~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ |
| Line-of-Sight Bulk Velocity ($v_{\rm bulk}$) | $263 \pm 23~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ |
| Redshift | Not specified in text (Systemic redshift reference implied for bulk velocity calculation) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- No specific URLs, databases, or software repositories were cited in the provided text.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*Based on the context provided in the abstract:*
- **ICM Dynamics as Diagnostics:** Bulk and turbulent motions in the intracluster medium are critical physical parameters for distinguishing between relaxed and merging galaxy clusters.
- **Turbulent Reacceleration Models:** The presence of radio halos in merging clusters is theoretically linked to turbulent reacceleration of electrons; therefore, direct measurements of turbulence offer a test for the efficiency of this mechanism.
- **XRISM Capabilities:** The Resolve instrument on XRISM provides the spectral resolution ($E/\Delta E$) necessary to resolve velocity broadening in emission lines, a capability previously lacking in X-ray observatories like Chandra or XMM-Newton (which had insufficient spectral resolution for direct velocity measurements in clusters).

### [AVID: A Near-Major Post-Merger of Late-Type Dwarfs beneath a Regularly Rotating HI Disk (VCC 693)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21676)

**Authors:** Fujia Li, Hong-Xin Zhang, Elias Brinks, Se-Heon Oh, Rory Smith, Zesen Lin, Weibin Sun, Yu-Zhu Sun, et al. (26 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
High-resolution observations of the dwarf galaxy VCC 693 in the Virgo cluster outskirts reveal a post-merger remnant with a settled, regularly rotating HI disk masking complex optical tidal features, resulting from a near-major "damp" merger that contributes to galactic pre-processing.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Merger Origin:** VCC 693 is identified as a post-merger remnant of two late-type dwarfs with a stellar mass ratio of 3:1–4:1; the system is classified as a "damp merger," indicating one progenitor was gas-poor.
- **Morphological Decoupling:** The optical body displays complex tidal structures indicative of a recent interaction, while the HI gas has surprisingly settled into a regular rotating disk.
- **Physical Properties:** Compared to similar-mass dwarfs, VCC 693 shows moderately enhanced central star formation and gas-phase metallicity, but broadly consistent global SFR and HI content; rotation curve modeling indicates a high dark matter halo concentration.
- **Pre-processing Evidence:** The study provides strong evidence that major dwarf mergers in cluster outskirts can produce remnants resembling ordinary dwarfs, highlighting the role of environmental pre-processing before cluster infall.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational Focus:**
- The study utilizes a multi-wavelength approach combining high-resolution HI mapping with deep optical imaging and spectroscopy, supported by hydrodynamical simulations to constrain the merger scenario.
- **Methodology:** The team analyzed HI kinematics (velocity fields, rotation curves) and surface density profiles using VLA (high resolution) and FAST (high sensitivity). They performed stellar population analysis and metallicity measurements using optical spectroscopy. A rotation curve decomposition was executed to derive dark matter halo properties.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Target | VCC 693 (Virgo Cluster outskirts) |
| Merger Mass Ratio | 3:1 – 4:1 (Stellar) |
| Merger Type | Damp (one gas-poor progenitor) |
| Key Instruments | VLA, FAST, Optical Spectrographs |
| Project | AVID (Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies) |

**Simulation Support:**
- Hydrodynamical simulations were employed to reproduce the observed tidal features and the settled HI disk, helping to constrain the merger orbital parameters and timeline.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **Project:** AVID (Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies)
- **Telescopes:** Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST)
- *Note: Specific software repositories or external database URLs were not provided in the abstract.*

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Cluster Outskirts Dynamics:** The periphery of galaxy clusters offers an environment with moderately high densities and velocity dispersions, favoring interactions and mergers that "pre-process" galaxies before they fall into the main cluster potential.
- **Dwarf Merger Surveys:** Observational studies of merger phases in dwarf galaxies remain rare, creating a gap in understanding how these events influence dwarf evolution compared to massive galaxies.
- **Merger Remnant Identification:** A key challenge in the field is that major dwarf mergers can produce remnants with stellar structures indistinguishable from non-interacting dwarfs, requiring high-resolution gas kinematics (like HI) to reveal their true history.

### [The supersonic nature of jellyfish galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21821)

**Authors:** Alessandro Ignesti, Francesca Loi, Antonino Marasco, Benedetta Vulcani, Bianca M. Poggianti, Christoph Pfrommer, Marco Gullieuszik, Alessia Moretti, et al. (23 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
This paper provides observational evidence that supersonic motion (Mach number > 1) is a necessary condition for triggering star formation in the stripped tails of jellyfish galaxies, linking shock compression and magnetic field draping to the survival of stripped gas.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
*   **Main Result:** The study establishes a positive correlation between the Mach number of a galaxy's motion through the intra-cluster medium (ICM) and the star formation activity in its stripped tail, concluding that supersonic motion is required to trigger this extraplanar star formation.
*   **Case Study (JO147):** MeerKAT observations of JO147 revealed polarized radio emission in the tail (fraction $\sim10\%$) and a low Mach number ($\mathcal{M}=1.3-1.6$), associating shock compression and magnetic field draping with the galaxy's weak tail star formation.
*   **Sample Analysis:** In a sample of 17 jellyfish galaxies from the GASP project, the authors inferred Mach numbers by combining dynamical orbital models with cluster temperature profiles, finding that galaxies with higher Mach numbers exhibit enhanced star formation in their tails.
*   **Physical Mechanism:** The findings suggest that shock compression induced by supersonic motion prevents the evaporation of stripped gas and likely enhances the surrounding magnetic field, creating conditions favorable for star formation.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational & Modeling Study:**
*   **Methodology:** The authors performed a detailed case study of JO147 using radio continuum and polarimetric observations to derive magnetic field properties and Mach numbers. They then expanded the analysis to a sample of 17 galaxies, deriving Mach numbers theoretically using galaxy orbits (from dynamical models) and local ICM sound speeds (from cluster temperature profiles), which were compared to star formation rates derived from optical/UV data (GASP survey).
*   **Quick Reference Table:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | 1 (JO147) + 17 (GASP sample) |
| Redshift range | Not specified in abstract (GASP typically $z \sim 0.05$) |
| Key instruments | MeerKAT (Radio), MUSE/VLT (GASP data) |
| Key derived parameters | Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$), Polarized fraction ($\sim10\%$) |
| Citation to note | GASP (GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies) project |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
*   **GASP survey:** Used for the sample of 17 jellyfish galaxies and star formation data.
*   **MeerKAT:** Radio continuum and polarization data for JO147.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*   **Context:** While all gas-rich galaxies in clusters undergo ram-pressure stripping, only a fraction develop "jellyfish" morphologies characterized by star formation in the stripped tail.
*   **Knowledge Gap:** The specific physical conditions that distinguish jellyfish galaxies from other stripped galaxies—specifically why stripped gas forms stars in some cases and evaporates in others—have been unclear.
*   **Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the role of magnetic fields and shock compression (specifically magnetic field draping) as potential drivers for extraplanar star formation.

### [Uncovering the absorbed atomic Universe with the [OI]63um line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22161)

**Authors:** Carlos De Breuck (ESO), Kevin C. Harrington (JAO/NAOJ/ESO/UDP), Wout Hermans (Gent), Luke Maud (ESO), Aniket Bhagwat (MPA), Ilse De Looze (Gent), Bo Peng (MPA), Amit Vishwas (Cornell), et al. (10 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
This first systematic survey of [OI]63um at z>4 reveals that the line is predominantly observed in absorption against the dust continuum in high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, challenging its reliability as a tracer of star formation.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main Result:** [OI]63um is detected in absorption in compact regions (0.05–0.2") against the FIR continuum in a sample of 12 DSFGs, with only 2 sources showing faint emission; this contradicts expectations of strong emission and is attributed to high optical depth.
- **Methodology:** The study utilizes ALMA Bands 9 and 10 to observe 12 DSFGs from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey at 4.2 < z < 5.8, achieving sensitivities 10–100 times deeper than previous studies and resolving the ISM on sub-kpc scales.
- **Unexpected Result:** The authors identify narrow [OI]63um emission "escape channels" in regions with weak dust continuum, suggesting that high optical depth in dense regions suppresses the line emission that is otherwise capable of escaping through lower-column-density sightlines.
- **Broader Impact:** The findings suggest that high optical depth significantly limits the diagnostic power of [OI]63um for tracing star formation in DSFGs, and the authors predict similar absorption effects may be found in [CII] observations of the densest gas regions.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational Study:**
- **Methodology:** The team analyzed spatially and spectrally resolved ALMA observations targeting the 63um fine-structure line of neutral oxygen. They compared [OI] profiles with other FIR lines ([CII], [NII]205um) and dust continuum emission to identify absorption features and "escape channels." They further compared their results with cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations to interpret the optical depth effects.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **[OI]63um as a Tracer:** The [OI]63um line is a primary coolant of the neutral interstellar medium and is theoretically expected to be a luminous tracer of massive star formation, often predicted to be brighter than [CII] in dense, warm gas.
- **Previous Limitations:** Prior to this study, observations of [OI]63um at z>4 were limited, lacking the depth and resolution required to investigate absorption effects, leading to an incomplete understanding of its behavior in high-redshift DSFGs.
- **Optical Depth Effects:** The introduction likely highlights the growing awareness that far-infrared lines can become optically thick in high-column-density environments, a critical factor for interpreting line ratios and gas masses in early Universe galaxies.

**Authors:** Chi-Hong Lin, Michiko S Fujii, Takayuki R Saitoh, Yutaka Hirai
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

*   **Main Problem:** The physical processes driving the structural diversity and varying stellar-to-halo mass ratios in low-mass dwarf galaxies are not well understood.
*   **Methodology:** The authors utilized high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to model eight dwarf galaxies with halo masses of $\sim 10^9 M_\odot$.
*   **Key Results:** The simulations reveal a scatter of nearly two orders of magnitude in stellar-to-halo mass ratios and show that high central gas surface densities ($\gtrsim 30 M_\odot \text{pc}^{-2}$) produce compact stellar systems similar to ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs).
*   **Significance:** These findings suggest that UCDs can form in situ within isolated dark matter halos, linking early gas conditions to the diverse morphologies observed in dwarf galaxies.

### [FRESCO: Constraining Dust Attenuation and Star-Formation Rates of $z\sim 2$ Star-Forming Galaxies with JWST Paschen and Ground-Based Balmer Emission Line Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21329)

**Authors:** Michael A. Wozniak, Naveen A. Reddy, Pascal A. Oesch, Ivan Kramarenko, Jorryt Matthee, Chloe Neufeld, Irene Shivaei, Bahram Mobasher, et al. (10 total)
**Relevance Score:** 6.5/10

*   **Main Question:** How reliable are Balmer emission lines for measuring dust attenuation and star-formation rates (SFRs) in $z\sim2$ galaxies compared to the longer-wavelength Paschen lines?
*   **Methodology:** The study utilizes JWST Paschen emission line maps from the FRESCO survey alongside ground-based Balmer line data from MOSDEF for a sample of 77 galaxies at $z=1.43-2.65$.
*   **Key Result:** While average properties agree, Paschen lines reveal significantly higher reddening and SFRs in some galaxies; this occurs because Paschen lines are less affected by patchy dust geometries that bias Balmer decrements toward less obscured regions.
*   **Significance:** These findings indicate that Paschen lines provide a more robust measure of nebular reddening and total star formation, particularly in galaxies with non-uniform dust coverage.

### [Formation timescales for stellar bars in diverse galactic discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21748)

**Authors:** Matthew Frosst, Danail Obreschkow, Aaron Ludlow
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

This study investigates how disc structure and kinematics regulate the formation timescales of stellar bars, extending previous work to the thick and turbulent discs found at high redshifts.

*   **Methodology:** The authors analyzed 145 simulations of disc galaxies in both live and static dark matter haloes, correlating the exponential bar growth timescale with standard stability criteria.
*   **Key Results:** Bar formation timescales follow tight power laws with stability parameters; for Milky Way-like discs in live haloes, bars form within a Hubble time if the disc mass fraction $f_{\rm disc} \geq 0.18$. Bars in live haloes grow roughly twice as fast as those in static haloes.
*   **Significance:** The findings establish a universal empirical relation for bar formation that accounts for velocity dispersion and halo responsiveness, applicable to both local and early universe galaxies.

### [Optical Spectroscopy of Dwarf Galaxies at $z\sim 0.15$ in the COSMOS Field: Star Formation and Dust Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22035)

**Authors:** Zahra Sattari, Daniel D. Kelson, Bahram Mobasher, Nima Chartab, Vihang Mehta, Harry I. Teplitz, Shannon G. Patel
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

*   **Question:** This study investigates how star formation rates (SFRs) and dust attenuation properties differ between low-mass galaxies ($10^8–10^9 M_\odot$) and intermediate-mass galaxies.
*   **Method:** Using optical spectroscopy in the COSMOS field, the authors compare SFRs derived from H$\alpha$ emission against spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and analyze the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening.
*   **Result:** Both samples follow a tight SFR-stellar mass relation with a slope of $\sim 1.01$, but low-mass galaxies exhibit lower, mass-independent nebular attenuation and a constant nebular-to-stellar reddening ratio across specific SFRs.
*   **Significance:** These findings suggest that while low-mass galaxies follow global scaling laws similar to massive galaxies, their distinct dust behavior results from efficient birth cloud dispersal and feedback-driven interstellar medium conditions.

(9 total)
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

*   **Main Question:** The study investigates the "turning-on" phase of active galactic nuclei (AGN), testing the theory that obscured accretion marks the initial transition from a quiescent galaxy to an active one.
*   **Methodology:** Researchers analyzed multi-wavelength data spanning 14 years, including mid-infrared (IR) light curves from WISE/NEOWISE, optical data from ASAS-SN, spectroscopy from SPHEREx, and X-ray observations from NuSTAR.
*   **Key Results:** The galaxy NGC 6447 showed a monotonic 1.2 mag increase in mid-IR brightness over 14 years while optical emission remained constant, with X-ray data confirming a low-luminosity AGN ($8.4 \times 10^{41}$ erg/s) that likely transitioned to an active state around 2018.
*   **Significance:** This case study validates long-term infrared variability as an effective tool for identifying AGN activation events and suggests the duty cycle for such accretion episodes is approximately $10^4$–$10^6$ years.

### [Linear Perturbations and Multi-Probe Diagnostics in Dark-Sector Selective $f(R,T_{\chi})$ Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21774)

**Authors:** L. Yildiz, D. Kayki, E. Gudekli
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

• **Problem:** Standard $f(R,T)$ gravity models suffer from theoretical ambiguities regarding the matter Lagrangian and typically imply untested modifications to the physics of visible matter.
• **Method:** The authors develop a "dark-sector selective" extension of gravity where curvature couples exclusively to the trace of the dark-matter energy-momentum tensor, deriving the exact field equations and linear scalar perturbations.
• **Result:** The analysis reveals that this model produces correlated, scale- and time-dependent departures from General Relativity in both structure growth and light deflection observables.
• **Significance:** This work establishes a microphysically consistent framework for testing modified gravity, offering a specific multi-probe strategy using redshift-space distortions and lensing to break degeneracies inherent in background expansion tests.

### [CALIMA: On-the-fly dust and PAH evolution for radiation-hydrodynamics galaxy formation simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21790)

**Authors:** Francisco Rodr\'iguez Montero, Yohan Dubois, Harley Katz, Adrianne Slyz, Julien Devriendt
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

• Most galaxy simulations lack comprehensive treatments of dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), despite their critical influence on the thermodynamics, chemistry, and radiative state of the interstellar medium (ISM).

• The authors introduce CALIMA, a module for the RAMSES code that self-consistently evolves two-size dust populations and PAHs through processes like stellar injection, accretion, shattering, and sputtering, coupling them directly to radiative transfer and non-equilibrium chemistry.

• Simulations reveal that evolving dust properties significantly alters classical thermal phase diagrams and drives environment-dependent variations in dust-to-metal ratios and PAH fractions, which in turn affect infrared emission and H$_2$ formation.

• This framework provides a physically motivated tool for interpreting dust-based observations and assessing the impact of dust-mediated feedback throughout cosmic history.
