### [SPT-CL J0417-4748: A Deep Chandra Study of a Relaxed Galaxy Cluster Without Central Star Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16295)

**Authors:** Taweewat Somboonpanyakul, Adam B. Mantz, Steven W. Allen, Anthony M. Flores, R. Glenn Morris, Haley R. Stueber, Lindsey E. Bleem, Benjamin Floyd, et al. (10 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

SPT-CL J0417-4748 is a massive, dynamically relaxed galaxy cluster at z = 0.58 with a short central cooling time (~500 Myr) and dense cool core that nevertheless shows no evidence of recent star formation or active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in its central galaxy, demonstrating that feedback mechanisms can completely suppress cooling flows even under thermodynamically favorable conditions.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **Quenched cool-core paradox:** Despite exhibiting classic cool-core signatures—central electron density of 0.08 ± 0.01 cm⁻³, pseudo-entropy of 26^{+6}_{-5} keV cm², and a cooling time of 515^{+96}_{-75} Myr—the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) shows no star formation over the past ~3 Gyr and no [O II] λ3727 emission, challenging the typical correlation between short cooling times and central star formation.
- **Multi-wavelength characterization:** The analysis combines 103 ks of Chandra X-ray imaging/spectroscopy with Dark Energy Survey (DES) optical photometry (SED fitting yields bulk stellar population formation at z ~ 1.25), Magellan optical spectroscopy, ASKAP radio continuum, and Spitzer infrared observations to constrain both ICM thermodynamics and BCG activity.
- **Absent AGN activity:** Complementary radio and infrared data reveal no strong current AGN activity in the BCG, suggesting the system may be in a feedback "downtime" or that previous feedback episodes were sufficient to long-term quench the cooling flow without requiring currently active radio jets.
- **Implications for feedback models:** This system exemplifies a population of massive relaxed clusters where AGN feedback appears to have established a long-term thermal equilibrium that prevents the condensation of the hot ICM, providing constraints on the duty cycles and energy injection required to maintain quiescence in cool-core systems.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Study type:** Deep multi-wavelength observational analysis of a single galaxy cluster.

**Methodologies:** The team analyzed Chandra ACIS-I imaging and spectroscopy to derive ICM thermodynamic profiles (density, temperature, entropy, cooling time) and assess dynamical state via X-ray morphology. They performed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting on DES grizY photometry to constrain the BCG stellar population age and star formation history. Optical spectroscopy from Magellan provided emission-line diagnostics ([O II] λ3727), while ASKAP 888 MHz radio continuum and Spitzer/IRAC infrared data constrained AGN activity and dust-obscured star formation.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- The cooling flow problem and the regulation of ICM thermal balance: In the absence of heating, the short cooling times (<1 Gyr) in cluster cores should lead to massive condensation of hot gas and vigorous star formation, yet observations show that cooling is typically curtailed at ~10% of the expected rate, implicating AGN feedback as the primary heating mechanism.
- The cool-core/star formation connection: While cool-core clusters often host star-forming BCGs with molecular gas reservoirs and dust lanes, a subset of relaxed systems show quiescent BCGs despite favorable thermodynamic conditions, raising questions about the duty cycles of AGN feedback and the timescales required to quench cooling flows.
- Redshift evolution of feedback: Studying relaxed clusters at intermediate redshifts (z ~ 0.5–0.6) constrains whether the mechanisms that suppress cooling flows were already efficient at cosmic noon, when cluster assembly and AGN activity were more prevalent.

### [CLASH-VLT velocity anisotropy profiles in a stack of massive galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15934)

**Authors:** E. Maraboli, A. Biviano, C. Grillo, A. Mercurio, L. Pizzuti, P. Rosati, M. D'Addona
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The study finds that galaxies in massive clusters exhibit increasingly radial orbits (velocity anisotropy $\beta$ rising from $\sim$0.3 to $>$0.8) from the center to the virial radius, with a suggestive localized dip at $\sim$250 kpc, and this behavior is consistent across red, blue, high-mass, and low-mass galaxy populations.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Radial anisotropy profile**: The velocity anisotropy grows from $\beta \approx 0.2-0.4$ at the cluster center to $\beta \gtrsim 0.8$ at the virial radius, indicating isotropic-to-mildly-radial orbits in the core transitioning to strongly radial orbits in the outskirts
- **Robust sample**: Analysis of 9 massive clusters ($M_{200c} > 7\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) at intermediate redshifts ($0.18 < z < 0.45$) using stacked projected phase space from CLASH-VLT spectroscopy enhanced by MUSE observations, divided into four populations (red/blue by colour, high/low by stellar mass)
- **Unexpected substructure**: Both parametric (MAMPOSSt) and non-parametric (Jeans inversion) methods reveal a localized drop in $\beta(r)$ at $\sim 250$ kpc from the cluster center, possibly indicating a dynamical transition region or infall signature *[verification needed: physical origin not yet established]*
- **Population universality**: The similarity of anisotropy profiles across different galaxy populations (passive vs. star-forming, massive vs. low-mass) suggests a universal orbital structure for cluster members, providing a critical prior for reducing systematic uncertainties in cluster mass calibration for cosmology

- Jeans equation inversion techniques for non-parametric $\beta(r)$ recovery
- Projected phase-space distributions (line-of-sight velocities vs. projected radii)
- arXiv: 2602.15934

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- The velocity anisotropy parameter $\beta(r) = 1 - \sigma_t^2/\sigma_r^2$ is a critical unknown in the Jeans equations that creates a fundamental degeneracy between inferred mass profiles and orbital structure in galaxy clusters
- Previous attempts to measure $\beta(r)$ in clusters were limited by small spectroscopic samples (typically hundreds of members) and often restricted to passive galaxies only, leaving open questions about dynamical differences between populations
- Accurate characterization of $\beta(r)$ is essential for calibrating cluster mass-observable relations, which are primary cosmological probes for $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ in current and upcoming large spectroscopic surveys (e.g., Euclid, Rubin Observatory, DESI)

### [Little Red Dots as Globular Clusters in Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15935)

**Authors:** John Chisholm, Danielle A. Berg, Michael Boylan-Kolchin, Anna de Graaf, Lukas J. Furtak, Vasily Kokorev, Jorryt Matthee, Julian B. Mu\~noz, et al. (10 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
This paper proposes that Little Red Dots (LRDs)—compact, red JWST sources at $z\sim5-7$—are not accreting supermassive black holes but rather forming globular clusters powered by supermassive stars ($>10^4\,M_\odot$), with evolutionary models predicting a present-day mass function (turnover at $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot)=5.3$) and number density ($\sim0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$) consistent with local globular cluster populations.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Alternative Power Source:** LRD spectra are consistent with emission from young stellar populations (rest-frame UV) plus short-lived supermassive stars $>10^4\,M_\odot$ (rest-frame optical), rather than AGN accretion disks; however, observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities suggest the presence of optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current stellar models.
- **Evolutionary Link to Local Globular Clusters:** Under standard mass-loss and evolutionary prescriptions, the $z\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function of LRDs evolves into a present-day mass function with a characteristic turnover at $\log_{10}(M_\ast/M_\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential high-mass cutoff, matching the observed mass function of local globular clusters.
- **Cosmological Abundance:** The predicted total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts is $\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, comparable to the observed number density of local globular clusters, with the observed redshift range ($z\sim5-7$) matching the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters (notably lacking counterparts to metal-rich populations).
- **Testable Chemical Predictions:** The model predicts specific chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including helium and nitrogen enhancement, plus potential sodium-oxygen and aluminum-magnesium anti-correlations, offering observational tests of the hypothesis.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper Type:** Theoretical/Interpretive — proposes a new physical scenario for observed LRDs using stellar population synthesis, spectral modeling, and cosmological evolutionary calculations.

**Core Methodology:**
- Spectral synthesis modeling comparing LRD observed profiles (UV/optical) against composite models of young stellar populations plus supermassive stars ($>10^4\,M_\odot$)
- Evolutionary modeling of the UV luminosity function from $z\sim5-7$ to $z=0$ using standard stellar mass-loss prescriptions
- Chemical evolution modeling to predict multiple stellar population (MSP) signatures

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Target redshift range | $z \sim 5-7$ |
| Proposed progenitor mass | $>10^4\,M_\odot$ (supermassive stars) |
| Predicted mass function turnover | $\log_{10}(M_\ast/M_\odot) = 5.3$ |
| Predicted number density | $\approx 0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$ |
| Key discrepancy noted | Observed $T_{\rm eff}$ and $L_{\rm bol}$ require winds not fully captured by current models |

**Important Caveat:** The authors note that while spectral profiles are "broadly consistent," the detailed temperature and luminosity measurements favor emission reprocessed by optically thick winds that current theoretical models do not fully reproduce; this represents a key uncertainty requiring further modeling.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- No specific archival datasets, software repositories, or URLs are mentioned in the provided abstract/metadata.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **LRD Context:** LRDs represent one of the most unexpected discoveries from JWST—numerous, compact ($\lesssim100$ pc), red sources at $z>5$ whose energy sources (AGN vs. stellar) remain debated, with standard AGN interpretations facing challenges regarding Eddington ratios and host galaxy properties.
- **Globular Cluster Formation Gap:** The formation epoch and physical mechanisms of metal-poor globular clusters (which form at high redshift) remain poorly constrained observationally; current theories struggle to explain their high masses, compact sizes, and the origin of multiple stellar populations without requiring exotic physics.
- **Supermassive Stars as a Link:** Supermassive stars ($10^4-10^6\,M_\odot$) have been proposed as potential precursors to massive black holes and as pollution sources for multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, but observational signatures of such objects in the early Universe have remained elusive until potentially now.

### [The large cores of dark matter and globular clusters in AS1063. Possible evidence of self-interacting dark matter. Or not](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15940)

**Authors:** Jose M. Diego
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

Deep JWST observations of the galaxy cluster AS1063 reveal that both dark matter and globular clusters exhibit large central cores—with the globular cluster core being approximately half the size of the dark matter core—a configuration that may favor self-interacting dark matter with $\sigma_{\rm SI} \approx 0.3$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$, though current simulation limitations prevent definitive exclusion of standard cold dark matter.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **Dual large cores detected:** Both the dark matter distribution (traced by gravitational lensing) and the globular cluster population (tens of thousands detected) in AS1063 exhibit large central cores, but the globular cluster core radius is roughly half that of the dark matter core ($R_{\rm core,GC} \approx 0.5 \times R_{\rm core,DM}$)
- **Tension with standard models:** The authors argue that both standard cold dark matter (CDM) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) models struggle to explain the existence and relative sizes of these large cores simultaneously **[Claim requires verification: FDM typically produces large cores; the tension may involve specific core size ratios or cluster-scale constraints]**
- **Favored alternative:** Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with a velocity-dependent cross-section of $\sigma_{\rm SI} \approx 0.3$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$, combined with core stalling mechanisms, offers a natural explanation for the observed core properties in galaxy cluster halos
- **Fundamental limitation:** The lack of hydrodynamical N-body simulations capable of resolving individual globular clusters within trillion-particle cluster-scale halos currently prevents ruling out standard non-collisional dark matter scenarios, highlighting an urgent need for future high-resolution computational efforts

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational study** combining deep imaging, lensing reconstruction, and surface density profiling:

- **Methodology:** Deep JWST imaging of AS1063 used to detect globular clusters and construct a gravitational lensing mass model; comparison of spatial distributions between lensing mass (dark matter-dominated) and globular cluster surface density profiles; measurement of core sizes in both components
- **Key Analysis:** Statistical comparison of core radii between dark matter and globular cluster distributions to test dark matter model predictions
- **Theoretical Modeling:** Comparison of observed core sizes against predictions from CDM, fuzzy dark matter (ultra-light axion), and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) scenarios with velocity-dependent cross-sections

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Target | Galaxy cluster AS1063 (Abell S1063) |
| Primary instrument | JWST (imaging) |
| Globular cluster sample | Tens of thousands detected |
| Mass tracer | JWST-based strong gravitational lensing model |
| Core size ratio | $R_{\rm core,GC} / R_{\rm core,DM} \approx 0.5$ |
| Favored SIDM parameter | $\sigma_{\rm SI} \approx 0.3$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ |
| Simulation requirement cited | Trillion-particle hydrodynamical simulations with $>10^5$ resolved globular clusters |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS

- JWST imaging data of the galaxy cluster AS1063 (specific filters and programs not detailed in abstract)
- Gravitational lensing mass model constructed from JWST data (methodology references not specified)
- *(No specific URLs, GitHub repositories, or database identifiers provided in available text)*

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- **The core-cusp problem:** Standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulations generically predict cuspy dark matter density profiles ($\rho \propto r^{-1}$) at halo centers, while observations of galaxy clusters and dwarf galaxies increasingly favor flat central cores, motivating exploration of alternative dark matter physics
- **Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and core stalling:** SIDM predicts the formation of large constant-density cores through collisional relaxation; "core stalling" refers to the halting of core collapse in high-density environments, potentially maintaining large core sizes in galaxy clusters over cosmic time
- **Globular clusters as halo tracers:** The observed close correspondence between globular cluster systems and dark matter halos suggests globular clusters form during early, chaotic assembly phases and may serve as independent tracers of the gravitational potential and dark matter properties, providing a complementary probe to lensing mass maps

### [Gas Accretion versus BH Merger driven Growth Modes of Supermassive Black Holes and Implications for the Little Red Dots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15952)

**Authors:** Paramita Barai
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations reveal that supermassive black holes undergo an early phase of merger-driven growth to $\sim 10^7 M_\odot$ followed by delayed Eddington-limited gas accretion that builds most of their mass over 600–700 Myr, suggesting that Little Red Dots host either normally-growing (merger-dominated) or overmassive (accretion-burst) black holes depending on their evolutionary stage.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **Bimodal growth phases**: BHs start as $10^5 M_\odot$ seeds and grow initially via mergers to $\sim 10^7 M_\odot$, after which gas accretion dominates, reaching Eddington rates only after 7–9 Gyr and driving a rapid $10^2-10^3$× mass increase to $10^9-10^{10} M_\odot$ over 600–700 Myr
- **Feedback-limited maximum mass**: Despite efficient early accretion, SMBHs do not exceed $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$ by $z=0$ due to AGN feedback depleting central gas reservoirs
- **Coevolution trajectory**: SMBHs initially lie *below* the $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ relation and evolve upward toward it, rather than forming on the local scaling relation
- **[Verification needed] LRD interpretation**: The dichotomy between normal-mass and overmassive black holes in JWST Little Red Dots is interpreted as distinct evolutionary stages—merger-driven growth for normal masses versus Eddington or super-Eddington accretion bursts for overmassive systems; this connection is theoretical and requires observational validation

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper type:** Simulation-based cosmological study

**Simulation Framework:**
- **Volume**: $(50~{\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving cosmological boxes
- **Initial conditions**: $10^5 M_\odot$ black hole seeds placed in evolving dark matter halos
- **Physics modeled**: Hydrodynamics with cosmological gas inflows/outflows, black hole feedback with varied parameterizations, and two-body BH mergers
- **Temporal coverage**: Evolution tracked from seed formation to $z=0$, focusing on the transition from merger-dominated ($M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^7 M_\odot$) to accretion-dominated growth

**Key Analyses:**
- Decomposition of mass growth into merger versus gas accretion contributions as functions of redshift/time
- Evolutionary tracks on the $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ plane compared to observed local scaling relations
- Gas accretion rate evolution relative to Eddington limits, identifying a delayed onset of Eddington-limited accretion at $t \approx 7-9$ Gyr
- Application to high-redshift galaxy populations: interpreting Little Red Dot SMBH mass distributions in the context of predicted growth modes

**Observational Connections:**
- Successfully reproduces the observed local upper mass limit of $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$ for SMBHs via feedback regulation
- Explains overmassive BHs (above the $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ relation) at high redshift as systems undergoing rapid Eddington-limited or super-Eddington accretion bursts before feedback quenches further growth

- Specific simulation code (e.g., GADGET, AREPO, or proprietary code) not identified in the abstract
- Analysis scripts or data release URLs not provided in the abstract
- *(Note: Full text would typically reference specific cosmological hydrodynamics codes and data availability statements)*

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- **Little Red Dots (LRDs):** A recently discovered population of high-redshift galaxies identified in JWST observations, characterized by red spectral energy distributions and point-source morphologies indicative of AGN activity, potentially hosting billion-solar-mass black holes at $z \sim 5-10$
- **Growth mode debate:** The relative contributions of gas accretion versus black hole mergers to SMBH mass assembly across cosmic time, and whether the dominant growth mechanism varies with redshift, host galaxy properties, or black hole mass
- **Coevolution paradigm:** The observed $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ scaling relation and whether high-redshift systems follow the local relation or exhibit offsets indicating different formation pathways, particularly for "overmassive" black holes that challenge standard coevolution models

### [Early Results from the Coma Legacy IFU Survey (CLIFS): Ram Pressure Induced Shocks and Ionization in Jellyfish Tails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15976)

**Authors:** Lauren M. Foster, Ian D. Roberts, Laura C. Parker, Timothy A. Davis, Alessandro Ignesti, Sean McGee, Nikki Zabel, Ming Sun, et al. (9 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
WEAVE Large-IFU observations of Coma cluster jellyfish galaxies reveal that their stripped gas tails are dominated by ram pressure-driven shock ionization—exhibiting LINER-like emission and elevated velocity dispersions—rather than by star formation, challenging standard interpretations of tail emission.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Shock-dominated ionization:** Tails show LINER-like [OI]/Hα ratios on BPT diagrams, enhanced [OII]/Hα relative to galaxy disks, and velocity dispersions elevated above disk values, indicating shock excitation rather than photoionization from young stars  
- **Methodology and sample:** Analysis of 5 preliminary targets from the Coma Legacy IFU Survey (CLIFS), selected via one-sided radio continuum tails; full survey will comprise 29 galaxies; WEAVE emission line fluxes validated against existing MaNGA disk measurements  
- **Breakdown of SFR indicators:** Resolved radio continuum and Hα star formation rates agree in the disks but disagree significantly in the tails, demonstrating that standard SFR calibrations fail in ram pressure stripped gas  
- **Broader implications:** Provides definitive evidence that ram pressure stripping produces strong shocks in the intracluster medium, requiring reinterpretation of emission line diagnostics in cluster galaxy outskirts and highlighting that not all "tail" emission traces star formation

- **MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory):** Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV data used for cross-validation of disk emission line fluxes  
- **Radio continuum imaging:** Unspecified archival or survey data used for target selection (one-sided tail identification) and star formation rate comparison  

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Jellyfish galaxies represent the most extreme observable cases of ram pressure stripping (RPS), where infalling cluster galaxies lose significant gas masses to the intracluster medium via dynamical pressure  
- The physical origin of optical emission in stripped tails remains controversial, with potential mechanisms including shock heating from RPS, photoionization from in-situ star formation, or thermal conduction from the hot intracluster medium  
- Radio continuum tails provide an efficient selection method for identifying galaxies undergoing active stripping, but the connection between synchrotron emission and optical line emission requires spectroscopic verification to distinguish between star formation and shock ionization processes

### [First Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) Feature in the 3-Point Correlation Function of DESI DR1 Luminous Red Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16134)

**Authors:** Farshad Kamalinejad, Zachary Slepian, Alex Krolewski, Alessandro Greco, William Ortol\'a Leonard, Jessica Chellino, Matthew Reinhard, Elena Fern\'andez-Garc\'ia, et al. (58 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

This paper presents the first high-significance detection ($\sim$8$\sigma$) of the baryon acoustic oscillation peak in the three-point correlation function of galaxies using over 2.1 million luminous red galaxies from DESI Data Release 1, measuring the cosmic distance scale to $1.1$--$1.7\%$ precision depending on the covariance estimation method.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **First robust 3PCF BAO detection**: The BAO feature is detected at $8.1\sigma$ significance using the EZmock covariance matrix and $8.5\sigma$ using the analytical Gaussian covariance matrix in the redshift range $0.4 < z < 1.1$ (effective redshift $z \approx 0.68$).
- **Distance scale measurement**: The angle-averaged distance ratio is measured as $D_{\rm V}(z = 0.68)/r_{\rm d} = 15.88 \pm 0.27$ ($1.72\%$ precision) with EZmock covariance versus $15.72 \pm 0.18$ ($1.12\%$ precision) with analytical covariance—a notable discrepancy suggesting the analytical method may underestimate errors or EZmocks contain excess variance.
- **Systematic validation**: Comparison with Abacus altMTL mocks reveals a $0.6\%$ offset in the recovered BAO scale, which is adopted as a systematic error budget; the model shows excellent agreement with independent DESI DR1 2PCF BAO measurements.
- **Methodological benchmark**: This establishes the 3PCF as a viable, competitive probe of cosmic expansion history using DESI data, with precision competitive with traditional two-point analyses.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational Analysis**

This is an observational cosmology paper analyzing spectroscopic galaxy survey data to extract higher-order clustering statistics. The analysis employs a tree-level redshift-space bispectrum template transformed to configuration space (the 3PCF) using the Fast Fourier Transform on Logarithmic scales (FFTLog) algorithm. The team validates their model against Abacus altMTL mocks—high-fidelity N-body simulations incorporating DESI-specific survey geometry—finding good agreement aside from the noted $0.6\%$ scale offset. They critically compare two covariance matrix approaches: one estimated from EZmock simulations and an analytical Gaussian covariance, finding substantially different precision estimates ($\sim$1.7\% vs $\sim$1.1\%).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | $>2.1$ million LRGs |
| Redshift range | $0.4 < z < 1.1$ ($z_{\rm full}$ sample), $z_{\rm eff} \approx 0.68$ |

| Data products | 3PCF BAO measurement, $D_{\rm V}/r_{\rm d}$ constraints |
| Citation to note | DESI DR1 2PCF BAO results (for cross-comparison) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS

- **DESI DR1 Luminous Red Galaxy catalog**: $>2.1$ million galaxies covering $0.4 < z < 1.1$
- **Abacus altMTL mocks**: High-precision alternative Multi-Tracer Lightcone mocks used for systematic validation
- **EZmocks**: Fast approximate simulations used for covariance matrix estimation
- **FFTLog algorithm**: For transforming the bispectrum model to the 3PCF in configuration space
- **arXiv ID**: 2602.16134 (preprint source)

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- The bispectrum and three-point correlation function contain complementary cosmological information to the power spectrum/two-point function, offering potential to break parameter degeneracies in growth of structure measurements and constrain primordial non-Gaussianity.
- Previous attempts to detect the BAO feature in the 3PCF have been limited by survey volume and shot noise, yielding only marginal detections; DESI DR1 provides the first dataset with sufficient galaxy density and survey volume to enable precision higher-order BAO measurements.
- Accurate covariance matrix estimation for higher-order statistics remains a critical challenge, with analytical Gaussian approximations potentially underestimating true uncertainties compared to simulation-based methods that capture non-Gaussian contributions and survey-specific systematics.

### [The Carousel Lens II: Cosmological Constraints with GIGA-Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16077)

**Authors:** Felipe Urcelay, Xiaosheng Huang, William Sheu, Jackson H. O'Donnell, Tesla Jeltema, Demetrius Y. Williams, Sean Xu, Shrihan Agarwal, et al. (31 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

The Carousel Lens—a massive, relaxed galaxy cluster with 11 multiply-imaged background sources—yields independent constraints on dark energy ($w = -1.31^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$) and matter density ($\Omega_m = 0.34^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$) from strong lensing alone that are competitive with CMB constraints for evolving dark energy models, demonstrating that single multi-source-plane cluster lenses can rival traditional cosmological probes.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **Primary constraints:** From the Carousel Lens alone (using 6 of 11 sources), the authors derive $w$CDM constraints of $\Omega_m = 0.34^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$ and $w = -1.31^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$, with systematic uncertainties currently dominating the error budget over statistical noise.
- **Source plane leverage:** The lens produces >40 extended images from 11 spectroscopically confirmed sources across multiple redshift planes; the analysis uses a pixel-level surface brightness model with 4 mass components in the GIGA-Lens pipeline.
- **Extrapolated precision:** Including four additional known high-redshift sources (not yet in the current model) could improve constraining power by ~80%, potentially achieving precision approaching that of the CMB and Type Ia supernovae for $w$CDM.
- **Dynamical dark energy:** For $w_0w_a$CDM models, the single-lens constraints are already comparable to CMB-only constraints, offering a complementary geometric probe that breaks degeneracies differently than BAO or supernovae.

**Note:** The claim that a single cluster lens can achieve precision "comparable to the CMB" for $w_0w_a$CDM is notable and suggests the Carousel Lens configuration is unusually constraining, though this should be verified against the specific Fisher matrix or MCMC details in the full paper.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Study Type:** Observational cosmography using strong gravitational lensing (cluster-scale).

**Methodology Summary:** The analysis employs the GIGA-Lens pipeline to perform pixel-level surface brightness modeling of extended arcs, simultaneously constraining the cluster's mass distribution (parameterized with 4 components) and cosmological parameters. Unlike traditional time-delay cosmography, this technique exploits the geometric ratios of angular diameter distances ($D_{\Delta t} \propto D_l D_s/D_{ls}$) inferred from relative deflection angles across multiple source planes at different redshifts. The "relaxed" dynamical state of the Carousel Lens's core reduces systematic uncertainties from complex substructure.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS

- **GIGA-Lens Pipeline:** Custom strong lens modeling software implementing pixel-level surface brightness reconstruction (specific repository not provided in abstract).
- **HST Imaging:** High-resolution imaging data for the Carousel Lens field (specific filters/programs not stated).
- **Spectroscopic Catalog:** Redshifts for 11 multiply-imaged sources confirmed via spectroscopy.
- **Paper Repository:** arXiv:2602.16077 [astro-ph.CO]

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- **Geometric Cosmography:** Multi-source-plane strong lenses constrain $\Omega_m$ and $w$ through distance ratios that depend only on angular diameter distances, providing a purely geometric probe independent of standard candles or rulers.
- **Historical Limitations:** Cosmological constraints from strong lensing have traditionally lagged behind CMB, BAO, and SNe Ia due to the "mass-sheet degeneracy," line-of-sight contamination, and the scarcity of clusters with both relaxed cores and rich sets of high-redshift multiple images.
- **Systematic Control:** Relaxed cluster cores with numerous extended arcs (like the Carousel Lens) are particularly valuable because the extended surface brightness structure breaks degeneracies between the lens mass profile slope and cosmological parameters more effectively than simple point-like image configurations.

### [Euclid preparation. Impact of galaxy intrinsic alignment modelling choices on Euclid 3x2pt cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16448)

**Authors:** Euclid Collaboration, D. Navarro-Giron\'es (Leiden Observatory, Leiden University, Einsteinweg 55, 2333 CC Leiden, The Netherlands), I. Tutusaus (Institute of Space Sciences, Institut d'Estudis Espacials de Catalunya, et al. (1825 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The Euclid Collaboration recommends adopting the redshift-dependent Tidal Alignment and Tidal Torquing (zTATT) model for Euclid's first data release 3x2pt analyses, as it provides the most flexible description of galaxy intrinsic alignments without significantly weakening cosmological constraints compared to simpler models.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Optimal IA model selection:** The redshift-dependent TATT (zTATT) model is identified as the optimal choice for Euclid DR1, offering sufficient flexibility to capture complex IA physics while maintaining constraining power comparable to the simpler Nonlinear Alignment (NLA) model.
- **Cosmological bias from model misspecification:** Significant biases in key parameters (particularly $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$) arise when the analysis model differs from the true underlying IA physics—specifically, fitting NLA to data generated with TATT (or vice versa) produces biased results, justifying the adoption of the more flexible zTATT framework.
- **Degeneracy with photometric redshifts:** Strong degeneracies exist between IA parameters and photometric redshift (photo-z) nuisance parameters, indicating that joint calibration of IA and photo-z systematics is essential to avoid biased cosmological constraints in the 3x2pt analysis.
- **Performance trade-offs:** Despite having more free parameters than NLA, zTATT does not substantially degrade the Figure of Merit for dark energy or growth of structure parameters, making it a robust "safe choice" given current theoretical uncertainties in IA physics.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

This is a **forecasting/simulation-based** paper preparing for Euclid Data Release 1 cosmological analyses.

**Methodology Summary:**  
The authors generate synthetic 3x2pt data vectors (combining cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering two-point functions) assuming various underlying IA models. They employ Fisher matrix forecasts to compare: (i) the constraining power on cosmological and IA parameters for each model, (ii) the parameter bias induced when the analysis model differs from the "true" data-generating model, and (iii) the covariance and degeneracies between IA and photo-z nuisance parameters. The analysis likely assumes Euclid's Wide Survey specifications with tomographic binning.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Survey | Euclid (DR1 forecast) |
| Analysis | 3x2pt (cosmic shear + GGL + galaxy clustering) |
| Redshift range | $z \approx 0-3$ (Euclid Wide Survey; tomographic) |
| IA models tested | Linear Alignment (LA), NLA, TATT, zTATT |
| Key parameters | $S_8$, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, $w_0$, $w_a$, IA amplitudes $A_1$, $A_2$, etc. |
| Systematics studied | Photo-z bias parameters $\delta z$ and scatter |
| Key metric | Bias on $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$ under model misspecification |

**Key Simulation References:**  
*Euclid Preparation papers* (series); likely references to Euclid Consortium mock galaxy catalogs and the official Euclid Flagship simulations for covariance estimation.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- Euclid preparation pipeline and synthetic 3x2pt data vectors (internal Euclid Consortium products)
- Fisher matrix forecasting tools (likely CosmoSIS or similar; specific software not detailed in abstract)
- arXiv:2602.16448 (preprint location)
- *Note:* Specific software repositories or public data releases are not mentioned in the abstract; full code likely remains internal to the Euclid Consortium pending data release.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Intrinsic Alignments as contaminants:** Galaxy intrinsic alignments (correlations between galaxy shapes and the tidal gravitational field) constitute one of the dominant systematic uncertainties for Stage IV weak lensing surveys, potentially biasing constraints on dark energy and modified gravity if unmodeled or mis-modeled.
- **3x2pt cosmological probe:** The combination of cosmic shear (shape-shape), galaxy-galaxy lensing (shape-position), and galaxy clustering (position-position) two-point statistics provides powerful constraints on cosmology by breaking degeneracies, but requires consistent modeling of IA which affect all three observables differently.
- **TATT vs. NLA physics:** While the Nonlinear Alignment (NLA) model describes linear tidal stretching of galaxy shapes, the Tidal Alignment and Tidal Torquing (TATT) model additionally captures higher-order correlations, scale-dependent bias, and angular momentum acquisition (torquing), which may become detectable at Euclid's precision but introduces more model complexity and potential degeneracies.

### [Updated Constraints on Infrared Cutoff Models and Implications for Large-Scale CMB Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16659)

**Authors:** Ujjwal Upadhyay, Yashi Tiwari, Tarun Souradeep
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Updated constraints from Planck CMB, DESI DR2 BAO, and supernova data demonstrate that infrared cutoff models of the primordial power spectrum do not provide statistically significant improvement over the standard power-law model and cannot accommodate a substantially increased reionization optical depth to resolve CMB-BAO tensions.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **No significant detection of IR cutoff:** Although IR cutoff models suppress large-scale power and marginally improve the fit to the low CMB quadrupole, the Bayesian evidence does not favor these models over the standard power-law spectrum once parameter penalties are accounted for.
- **Optical depth tension persists:** The additional freedom introduced by large-scale power suppression is statistically insufficient to support a substantial increase in the reionization optical depth ($\tau$), indicating that IR cutoff models do not resolve the recent CMB-BAO tension highlighted by DESI DR2 data.
- **Multi-probe constraints:** The analysis combines the latest CMB temperature and polarization data with DESI DR2 BAO and supernova observations to derive the strongest existing limits on cutoff scales and feature parameters in the primordial power spectrum.
- **Anomaly statistics unchanged:** Within a Bayesian framework, IR cutoff models do not significantly increase the probability of the observed large-scale CMB anomalies (e.g., quadrupole-octupole alignment), suggesting these anomalies remain unlikely even with modified initial conditions.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Paper Type:** Theoretical/Observational (phenomenological model constraints using existing survey data)

This work parametrises deviations from the standard power-law primordial power spectrum $P(k) \propto k^{n_s-1}$ using functional forms that implement an infrared (IR) cutoff (suppression at $k < k_c$), including sharp cutoffs and smooth exponential transitions. The authors perform Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit cosmological parameters simultaneously with cutoff features. They specifically test whether the suppression of large-scale temperature power can be traded against an increased optical depth $\tau$ to resolve parameter tensions.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Primary data | Planck CMB (TT, TE, EE + low-$\ell$), DESI DR2 BAO, Type Ia Supernovae |
| Redshift range | $z \sim 10^3$ (CMB), $z \lesssim 2.3$ (BAO/SNe) |
| Key parameters | Cutoff scale $k_c$ (Mpc$^{-1}$), feature steepness, $\tau$, $n_s$, $A_s$ |
| Model comparison | Bayesian evidence (likely $\Delta \ln \mathcal{Z}$ or DIC) vs. $\Lambda$CDM |
| Anomaly metrics | Bayesian probabilities for low-$\ell$ power deficits and alignments |

**Key references:** The analysis builds on previous IR cutoff studies (e.g., Contaldi et al. 2003; Sinha & Souradeep 2006) and incorporates the recent DESI DR2 BAO results that highlighted tensions in $\tau$ measurements.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **Planck 2018 (or NPIPE) CMB data:** Temperature and polarization power spectra (low-$\ell$ and high-$\ell$ likelihoods)
- **DESI DR2 BAO measurements:** Baryon acoustic oscillation constraints from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2
- **Type Ia Supernova sample:** Likely Pantheon+ or similar compilation (not explicitly named in abstract)
- **Analysis software:** Standard cosmological parameter estimation codes (e.g., **MontePython** or **Cobaya**) with modified primordial power spectrum modules; no new public code repositories explicitly mentioned in the abstract.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Large-scale CMB anomalies—including the unexpectedly low quadrupole power and alignments between the quadrupole and octupole—have persisted across Planck data releases and motivate phenomenological modifications to the primordial power spectrum at comoving scales $k \lesssim 0.01$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (the "infrared" regime).
- Recent DESI DR2 BAO measurements within the $\Lambda$CDM framework suggest a preference for a higher reionization optical depth ($\tau$) than inferred from Planck CMB data alone, creating a tension that might theoretically be alleviated if large-scale temperature power were suppressed (allowing higher $\tau$ without exceeding observed low-$\ell$ amplitudes).
- IR cutoff models represent a broad class of phenomenological inflationary modifications where the power spectrum transitions from a suppressed amplitude at large scales to the standard power-law at smaller scales, parameterized through various functional forms (sharp cutoff, exponential, or step-like transitions).

### [How Bursty is Star Formation at z>5?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16706)

**Authors:** Massimo Stiavelli, Massimo Ricotti
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
A purely bursty star formation model with ~100 Myr quiescent intervals between bursts and a power-law distribution of burst masses (slope α ≈ −2) can reproduce the observed M_UV–M_* relation of z > 5 galaxies without invoking continuous star formation, mergers, or dust.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Best-fit bursty model**: The simplest model that matches observations requires a quiescence period of Δt ~ 100 Myr between bursts, with stellar mass growing linearly from z = 12 to z = 5 through repeated bursts that each produce approximately equal stellar mass within a given galaxy.
- **[Verification needed]** The model assumes **no dust attenuation**, which may be difficult to reconcile with growing evidence for dust in z > 5 galaxies (including JWST detections of reddened continua and dust emission); the success of the model without dust suggests either that dust is subdominant in the UV mass estimates or that the model is missing a degenerate physical component.
- **Burst mass distribution**: The population of galaxies follows a power-law distribution of burst masses dN/dM_* ∝ M_*^α with slope α ~ −2, implying that low-mass bursts dominate the number density while high-mass bursts dominate the stellar mass budget.
- **Implications for z > 9–10**: Galaxies at these early epochs typically experienced only one or two bursts, meaning observed stellar masses reaching M_* ~ 10^10 M_⊙ approximately represent the mass of single bursts rather than accumulated secular growth, challenging smooth star formation history assumptions in SED fitting.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

This is a **theoretical/phenomenological modeling** paper.

**Core methodology**: The authors construct a parametric, forward-modeling framework to test whether bursty star formation alone—without continuous components, mergers, or dust—can explain the observed distribution of galaxies in the absolute UV magnitude (M_UV) versus stellar mass (M_*) plane. The model assumes: (1) a standard Initial Mass Function (IMF); (2) strictly episodic star formation with quiescent periods Δt; (3) constant burst mass per galaxy (yielding linear mass growth with cosmic time); and (4) a power-law distribution of burst masses across the galaxy population.

**Comparison to data**: Model predictions are compared against JWST observations at z > 5, specifically targeting the M_UV–M_* relation where deviations from smooth models are most apparent.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Model type | Parametric, phenomenological |
| Redshift range | z = 5–12 (emphasis on z > 5) |
| Quiescence timescale | Δt ~ 100 Myr |
| Burst mass function slope | α ~ −2 |
| Mass growth mode | Linear from z=12 to z=5 (equal-mass bursts) |
| Maximum stellar mass | M_* ~ 10^10 M_⊙ |
| Key assumptions | Standard IMF; no continuous SF; no mergers; no dust |

**Key references**: The work is motivated by JWST observational evidence and theoretical results from cosmological simulations predicting bursty star formation at high redshift.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- The paper utilizes published JWST observational data for model comparison (specific survey programs not detailed in the abstract; likely includes CEERS, JADES, or GLASS-JWST based on standard high-z galaxy samples)
- No new software tools or public datasets are introduced in this theoretical study
- Model code availability not specified in the abstract

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Cosmological simulations consistently predict that star formation at z > 5 is highly bursty due to efficient gas cooling and feedback-driven cycles, in tension with the smooth, exponentially declining star formation histories typically assumed in spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of observed galaxies.
- JWST observations have revealed a population of massive (M_* ~ 10^9–10^10 M_⊙), UV-bright galaxies at z > 9–10 whose existence timescales are difficult to reconcile with continuous star formation models, prompting questions about the role of mergers, dust, and stochastic assembly.
- The M_UV–M_* relation serves as a fundamental diagnostic of galaxy formation physics: its scatter and evolution constrain the duty cycles of star formation, the stochasticity of mass assembly, and the ubiquity of dust attenuation in the early universe.

### [A targeted machine learning approach for detecting diffuse radio emission with Astronomaly: Protege](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15930)

**Authors:** Verlon Etsebeth, Michelle Lochner, Konstantinos Kolokythas, Kenda Knowles, Emma Tolley
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

Diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters—such as radio halos and relics—traces non-thermal processes and magnetic fields, but its low surface brightness and contamination from compact sources make detection challenging and manual inspection unscalable for upcoming large surveys like the SKA.

The authors introduce an active learning pipeline that combines self-supervised deep learning (Bootstrap Your Own Latent) with the Astronomaly: Protege anomaly detection framework to identify candidates from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey, testing high-resolution, convolved, and combined image features.

Combining features from different resolutions yields the best performance: 99% of the top 100 ranked candidates exhibit diffuse characteristics, with 55% confirmed as cluster-related emission, demonstrating higher purity than single-resolution approaches.

This method minimizes required human labeling while maintaining high accuracy, providing a scalable tool for detecting both known and novel diffuse radio sources in the era of big data astronomy.

### [Implications of the nanoHertz Gravitational-Wave Background for Galactic Feedback and Massive Black Hole Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15938)

**Authors:** Megan Taylor Tillman, Blakesley Burkhart, Chiara M. F. Mingarelli, J. Andrew Casey-Clyde, Lars Hernquist, Sownak Bose, Eniko Regos, C\'esar Hern\'andez-Aguayo
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

- **Problem:** Current cosmological simulations struggle to simultaneously reproduce realistic galaxies and match the amplitude of the nanohertz gravitational-wave background (GWB) recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs).

- **Approach:** The authors combine black hole mass functions from major simulation suites (IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, Simba, and CAMELS) with quasar-based supermassive black hole binary population models to predict how different stellar and AGN feedback prescriptions affect the GWB signal.

- **Key Finding:** Standard feedback models that successfully form realistic galaxies suppress black hole growth too strongly, under-predicting the observed GWB amplitude by up to a factor of two (and up to ten in extreme variations), while models lacking feedback match the gravitational-wave data but fail to produce realistic galaxies. This tension suggests that supermassive black hole growth is more efficient or occurs earlier than captured by current simulations.

- **Significance:** These results demonstrate that PTA measurements provide a powerful new observational constraint on galactic feedback physics and the cosmic assembly history of massive black holes.

### [HOLISMOKES XX. Lens models of binary lens galaxies with five images of Supernova Winny](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16620)

**Authors:** L. R. Ecker, A. G. Schweinfurth, R. Saglia, L. Deng, S. H. Suyu, C. Saulder, J. Snigula, R. Bender, et al. (16 total)
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

• **Problem:** Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) like SN Winny provide unique laboratories for cosmology and galaxy physics, but realizing this potential requires precise models of the lensing mass. This paper addresses the challenge of modeling a rare binary lens system—two galaxies producing five images of a single supernova—which offers tight constraints but significant geometric complexity.

• **Methodology:** Using adaptive-optics-assisted imaging from the Large Binocular Telescope, the authors confirm the fifth lensed image and measure the positions of all five with milliarcsecond precision (1–14 mas uncertainties). They construct the first detailed mass models using **lenstronomy** and **GLEE**, exploring configurations with two lens galaxies (G1 and G2) plus external shear.

• **Key Results:** The optimal model combines a singular isothermal ellipsoid for G1 and a singular isothermal sphere for G2, yielding enclosed masses of $4.61^{+0.06}_{-0.04} \times 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ and $1.01\pm0.02 \times 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ within their Einstein radii. While the model fits the image positions with remarkable accuracy (RMS ~0.001–0.003 arcseconds), the predicted relative magnifications (ranging from ~1.6 to ~10) deviate from observations at the $2\sigma$ level, suggesting unresolved microlensing or millilensing effects.

• **Significance:** These mass models establish the essential foundation for future cosmological analyses of SN Winny, including time-delay measurements to constrain the Hubble constant, while highlighting the critical role of small-scale lensing effects in multi-image supernova systems.

### [High significance detection at 4.8 GHz of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster with the Sardinia Radio Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16364)

**Authors:** P. Marchegiani, M. Murgia, F. Loi, V. Vacca, F. Govoni, S. Cocchi, F. Gandossi
**Relevance Score:** 6.5/10

Radio halos in galaxy clusters are diffuse synchrotron sources powered by relativistic electrons, yet the high-frequency spectral behavior of the prototypical Coma cluster remained uncertain. Using the Sardinia Radio Telescope at 4.8 GHz, the authors achieve the first significant (>3σ) detection of Coma's radio halo at this frequency, measuring a flux density of $61\pm11$ mJy after subtracting discrete sources and correcting for the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The resulting steep spectral index of $\alpha\sim1.17$ between 4.8 and 6.6 GHz indicates that the spectrum continues to steepen at higher frequencies. This spectral trend supports models where turbulence re-accelerates seed electrons extending to high energies—such as those produced by hadronic interactions or dark matter annihilation—rather than simple secondary injection models.

### [What does it mean to take the mean? The effect of the averaging scale on the characterization of interstellar turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15932)

**Authors:** A. Konstantinou, E. Ntormousi, K. Tassis
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The characterization of turbulence in galaxies hinges on separating ordered and random components of magnetic and velocity fields, yet the choice of averaging scale fundamentally determines the measured properties. Using magnetohydrodynamic simulations of disk galaxies initialized with either toroidal or random magnetic fields, the authors decompose the fields via spherical filtering across varying radii to examine how smoothing affects turbulence metrics. They find that whether turbulence is classified as strong or weak—based on the ratio of fluctuating to mean energy—depends more sensitively on the averaging radius than on the initial magnetic configuration, with larger smoothing scales progressively steepening the power spectra. This scale-dependence demonstrates that turbulence metrics are not intrinsic system properties but analysis-dependent quantities, carrying significant implications for observational techniques such as the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method.

### [Exploring the Near Galactic Centre: A Comprehensive Study of Bulge OCs HSC 25, HSC 37, HSC 2878 Utilising Gaia DR3 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15937)

**Authors:** Deniz Cennet \c{C}{\i}nar, Waleed Elsanhoury, Aly Haroon
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

This study investigates the dynamical origins and evolutionary states of three open clusters located in the innermost Galactic disc, a region where stellar populations may have formed in situ or been accreted through dynamical heating.

Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry, the researchers identified member stars and derived fundamental properties including ages, metallicities, masses, and orbital parameters for clusters HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878.

The key finding reveals heterogeneous origins: despite all residing in the bulge region, HSC 25 and HSC 37 follow eccentric, high-velocity orbits consistent with accreted or dynamically heated populations, whereas HSC 2878 maintains a relaxed, planar orbit indicating in situ formation.

These results suggest that the inner Milky Way's stellar clusters have diverse formation histories, providing crucial constraints on models of bulge assembly and star formation in the Galaxy's most dynamic environment.

### [MadEvolve: Evolutionary Optimization of Cosmological Algorithms with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15951)

**Authors:** Tianyi Li, Shihui Zang, Moritz M\"unchmeyer
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

Optimizing algorithms for computational cosmology problems—such as reconstructing initial conditions or removing 21cm foregrounds—traditionally requires labor-intensive manual tuning. This work introduces MadEvolve, a framework that uses large language models to iteratively evolve scientific code from human-written baselines, optimizing free parameters through both gradient-based and gradient-free methods while auto-generating reports that explain the algorithmic changes. Applied to three key tasks (initial condition reconstruction, 21cm foreground removal, and baryonic physics in N-body simulations), the method achieves substantial performance improvements over existing approaches in all cases. This demonstrates an automated, interpretable approach to scientific algorithm discovery that enhances both computational efficiency and transparency, with the code made publicly available.

**Authors:** H. V. Ragavendra, Gianmassimo Tasinato, L. Sriramkumar
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

Generating primordial magnetic fields during inflation while avoiding strong coupling and observational constraints is a persistent challenge. This paper introduces a mechanism utilizing brief non-slow-roll phases combined with parity-violating (chiral) interactions to amplify small-scale vector fields. The authors demonstrate that chirality significantly enhances magnetic-field amplitudes and, for the first time in this framework, induces a circularly polarized stochastic gravitational-wave background with distinctive spectral features. These chiral signatures offer promising detection prospects for future multiband gravitational-wave observatories, providing a new window into early-Universe magnetism.

### [Interpreting the HI 21-cm cosmology maps through Largest Cluster Statistics III: Impact of the lightcone effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16651)

**Authors:** Hemanth Potluri, Manas Mohit Dosibhatla, Leon Noble, Chandra Shekhar Murmu, Suman Majumdar, Samit Kumar Pal, Saswata Dasgupta, Satadru Bag, et al. (9 total)
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

**Background:** Real 21-cm observations of the Epoch of Reionization are lightcones that span cosmic time, unlike static simulation snapshots. This study investigates how this redshift evolution affects percolation analysis—a technique that tracks the merging of ionized regions using the Largest Cluster Statistic (LCS)—and its power to distinguish between different reionization scenarios (e.g., galaxies versus AGN).

**Methodology:** The authors apply a moving volume approach to simulated 21-cm lightcone maps, calculating the LCS within subvolumes of varying bandwidth to quantify how the percolation transition appears when observed across different cosmic epochs simultaneously.

**Key Finding:** For all but one reionization model, the percolation transition inferred from lightcone data converges toward the coeval-box result as the observational bandwidth increases, indicating that wider frequency coverage effectively mitigates lightcone-induced biases.

**Significance:** These results validate that future wide-band 21-cm experiments can reliably use percolation statistics to differentiate between ionizing source models without requiring complex corrections for redshift evolution along the line of sight.
