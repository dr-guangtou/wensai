### [Cosmic Environment as the Primary Driver of Dwarf Satellite Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22485)

**Authors:** Saeed Tavasoli, Parsa Ghafour
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The distribution and abundance of satellite galaxies are primarily governed by cosmic environment, with host stellar mass and cosmic epoch acting as secondary modulators.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- Satellite abundance correlates strongly with host stellar and bulge mass, while host morphology has little additional impact once stellar mass is controlled for.
- Dense environments suppress satellite populations relative to voids, with radial profiles showing strong central concentrations in voids, flattened distributions in clusters, and intermediate trends in groups.
- The cosmic evolution of satellite abundance highlights distinct pathways: gradual accumulation in voids, mass-dependent trends in groups, and strong late-time suppression in clusters.
- The study uses the Millennium simulation combined with a semi-analytic model to analyze satellite populations from z=2 to z=0 across three host stellar mass bins (Mr < -16 for hosts and M_* >= 3x10^5 M_sun, Mr < -9 for satellites).

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

### [It's a matter of time: Empirical Constraints on Supernova Yields and Delay Times from Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22333)

**Authors:** Mair\'ead E. Heiger, Alexander P. Ji, Joshua S. Speagle, Ting S. Li, Alessandro Savino, Nathan R. Sandford, Evan N. Kirby, Mithi A. C. de los Reyes, et al. (9 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The paper presents empirical constraints on supernova yields and delay times using a galactic chemical evolution model applied to the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax, revealing discrepancies in existing yield models and a steeper delay-time distribution for Type Ia supernovae.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- The Fe yield from core collapse supernovae is consistent with existing theoretical yield models, while the measured Mg yield is a factor of 2-4 higher, suggesting that yield models may under-predict [Mg/Fe].
- The rate of Type Ia supernovae is enhanced by about a factor of 5 relative to field galaxies, with a delay-time distribution of \( \sim t^{-2} \), significantly steeper than the \( \sim t^{-1.1} \) measured from supernova surveys.
- The study uses a joint statistical model of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax, achieving simultaneous constraints on population-averaged yields and galactic outflows without fixing the absolute scale of nucleosynthetic yields.
- These findings suggest a potential metallicity dependence of the Type Ia rate and delay-time distribution, challenging current theoretical models.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper Type:** Theoretical/Modeling

**Core Logic and Main Methods:**
The authors introduce a galactic chemical evolution model called DLEIY, which uses observed star formation histories and metallicity distributions to reduce confounding factors in chemical abundance data. The model is applied to the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax to derive constraints on supernova yields and delay times.

**Quick Reference Table:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | N = 2 (Sculptor and Fornax) |
| Redshift range | z = 0 (local galaxies) |
| Key instruments | Not applicable (modeling) |
| Data products | Chemical abundance data from Sculptor and Fornax |
| Citation to note | Relevant theoretical yield models |

**Theoretical Model:**
- The DLEIY model incorporates observed star formation histories and metallicity distributions to derive constraints on supernova yields and delay times.
- The model does not fix the absolute scale of nucleosynthetic yields, allowing for a more flexible and empirical approach.
- The study derives joint constraints on population-averaged yields and galactic outflows, providing insights into the nucleosynthetic processes in dwarf galaxies.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- Chemical abundance data from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax.
- No specific URLs or software repositories mentioned.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Chemical abundances of stellar populations encode information about nucleosynthesis and its astrophysical sites, but this information is often confounded by the specific star formation history of the host galaxy.
- Previous efforts to place empirical constraints on supernova yields and timing using abundances have been challenging due to these confounding factors.
- The study aims to address these challenges by introducing a new galactic chemical evolution model (DLEIY) that uses observed star formation histories and metallicity distributions to reduce these confounding factors.

### [3D-Herschel: Constraining Dust Emission with Panchromatic Modeling of 3D-HST Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22384)

**Authors:** Seamus McNulty, Mimi Song, Katherine E. Whitaker, Joel Leja, Aubrey Medrano, Elijah P. Mathews, Mark Dickinson, Hanae Inami, et al. (12 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Including Herschel far-infrared data in spectral energy distribution modeling reveals significantly warmer dust temperatures and mass-dependent mid-to-total IR luminosity ratios that are missed by standard UV-mid-IR fitting, even though the latter still recovers accurate stellar masses and star formation rates for detected galaxies.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

*   **Dust Temperature Bias:** Models excluding FIR data underestimate dust temperatures by approximately 7 K at all redshifts studied ($0.5 < z < 2.5$) because rigid IR templates assume unevolving, cold dust properties.
*   **Stellar Property Robustness:** For the 3.2% of galaxies with strong FIR detections ($>3\sigma$ in $\geq 2$ bands), UV-MIR-only modeling recovers stellar ages, SFRs, and masses reliably (50-70% within $1\sigma$ errors), with the star-forming sequence showing a negligible systematic offset of $0.1 \pm 0.07$ dex.
*   **Mass-Dependent IR Luminosities:** FIR-inclusive fits show $\sim$0.2 dex higher IR-to-7.7$\mu$m luminosity ratios at low masses (log($M_{\star}$) $\sim$9.6 $M_{\odot}$) compared to fixed templates, demonstrating that MIR-to-IR conversions depend on stellar mass.
*   **Observational Limitations:** At $z > 1.5$, Herschel is confusion-limited for galaxies with $M_{\star} < 10^{11} \ M_{\odot}$, yielding only upper limits; next-generation FIR facilities are required to characterize dust in typical galaxies at this epoch.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational Paper Details:**
The paper presents a new photometric catalog and analyzes SED fitting results comparing models with and without FIR constraints.

*   **Methodology:** The authors use **Prospector-$\beta$**, a 17-parameter Bayesian SED fitting code, to model 41,387 galaxies. They compare fits using only UV-MIR data (0.3–24$\mu$m) against fits including deblended Herschel FIR data (100–350$\mu$m). The study specifically investigates the impact of fixed dust emission parameters ($\gamma$, $U_{\mathrm{min}}$, $Q_{\mathrm{PAH}}$) typically used in energy balance codes versus free parameters enabled by FIR data.
*   **Quick Reference Table:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | N = 41,387 galaxies |
| Redshift range | z = 0.5 – 2.5 |
| Key instruments | Herschel (PACS/SPIRE), HST (3D-HST), Spitzer, ground-based |
| Data products | 3D-Herschel photometric catalog (0.3-350$\mu$m) |
| Detection Rate | 3.2% with $>3\sigma$ detections in $\geq 2$ Herschel bands |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS

*   **Catalog:** 3D-Herschel (combines deblended Herschel imaging with CANDELS/3D-HST legacy fields).
*   **Software:** Prospector-$\beta$ (SED fitting code).
*   **Surveys:** CANDELS, 3D-HST.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

*   **The FIR Constraint Problem:** A major uncertainty in galaxy evolution studies is whether SED fitting limited to UV-MIR wavelengths can accurately constrain dust properties and obscured star formation, or if the lack of FIR data leads to systematic biases in derived physical properties.
*   **Template Limitations:** Standard UV-MIR SED fitting often relies on "log-average" IR templates with fixed dust emission parameters. This assumes a constant relationship between mid-IR emission (often used as a tracer) and total IR luminosity, an assumption this paper tests and challenges.
*   **The "Energy Balance" Assumption:** Many models assume energy absorbed in the UV-optical is re-emitted in the IR. Without FIR data, these models often default to cold dust temperatures, potentially misrepresenting the true dust heating conditions, particularly in lower-mass or high-redshift galaxies.

### [Little Red Dots as Obscured Little Blue Dots: A Super-Eddington Unification Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22386)

**Authors:** Piero Madau, Roberto Maiolino
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The paper proposes a unification model where "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are high-inclination, dust-reddened counterparts of "Little Blue Dots" (LBDs), both powered by super-Eddington accretion, explaining their observed properties through orientation-dependent effects.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main result with specific numbers/values if given:** The extreme broad Hα equivalent widths (EWs) of JWST LRDs are reproduced with global BLR covering factors of only 15%, consistent with standard Type 1 AGNs.
- **Methodology highlight (data used, sample size, redshift range):** The study uses inclination-dependent SEDs as input to Cloudy, modeling the central engine as a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure supported accretion flow. The sample includes JWST observations of LRDs.
- **Unexpected or surprising result (if any):** Large Balmer EWs arise because self-shadowing suppresses the high-inclination optical continuum while the BLR is illuminated by an EUV-rich SED, without requiring a fully enclosing gaseous "cocoon."
- **Connection to broader field (how does this change what we know?):** The model unifies LRD and LBD observables via orientation, predicting correlated trends in Hα EW, Balmer decrement, Balmer break, high-ionization line strengths, and IR emission, providing a coherent picture for these types of AGNs.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**If theoretical:**
- **Core logic and main methods:** The paper proposes a theoretical model where LRDs are dust-reddened, high-inclination counterparts of LBDs. The central engine is modeled as a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure supported accretion flow, coupled to an equatorially concentrated BLR and a dusty screen with modest covering factor.
- **Does it derive analytic expressions?** No, the paper primarily uses numerical modeling with Cloudy to simulate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs).
- **Does it build a theoretical model/picture?** Yes, the paper builds a theoretical model that unifies the observables of LRDs and LBDs through orientation-dependent effects.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- JWST observations of LRDs
- Cloudy modeling software

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- The paper addresses the nature of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) and their potential connection to "Little Blue Dots" (LBDs), both types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) powered by super-Eddington accretion.
- It discusses the challenges in understanding the extreme properties of LRDs, such as their large Balmer line equivalent widths and the need for a coherent model to explain these observations.
- The introduction highlights the importance of orientation-dependent effects in explaining the observed properties of these AGNs, suggesting that LRDs could be high-inclination, dust-reddened versions of LBDs.

### [Extreme Emission Line Galaxies in CEERS Are Powered by Star Formation, not AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23310)

**Authors:** Kelcey Davis, Madisyn Brooks, Jonathan R. Trump, Vital Fern\'andez, Taylor A. Hutchison, Rebecca L. Larson, Anthony J. Taylor, Elizabeth J. McGrath, et al. (31 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The study finds that extreme emission-line galaxies (EELGs) identified in the CEERS legacy deep field are primarily powered by star formation rather than active galactic nuclei (AGN), despite some photometrically selected EELGs hosting AGN.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main result with specific numbers/values if given:** The study identifies 6 new broad-line AGN at redshifts 3.5 < z < 7 using deep (~8 hr) G395M THRILS survey data.
- **Methodology highlight (data used, sample size, redshift range):** The research utilizes JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CAPERS, RUBIES, THRILS, and CEERS surveys, focusing on EELGs with observed-frame equivalent widths (EWs) >5000 Å of either Hα or Hβ + [OIII]. The sample size includes a master sample of photometrically identified EELGs.
- **Unexpected or surprising result (if any):** ~10% of photometrically selected EELGs have broad Balmer lines, which jumps to 35% in deep spectroscopy, indicating a significant fraction of photometrically selected EELGs may host AGN. However, many AGN selected as EELGs have incorrectly high photometric EWs.
- **Connection to broader field (how does this change what we know?):** This study challenges the assumption that extreme emission lines in galaxies are predominantly due to AGN activity, suggesting that star formation plays a dominant role even in the presence of AGN.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**If observational:**
- **Brief summary of key methodologies:** The study employs JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy to analyze photometrically identified EELGs in the CEERS legacy deep field. It uses a color-color plot designed for "Little Red Dot" selection to filter out AGN with non-extreme lines and compares emission-line morphology to EWs and continuum morphologies.

### [Filamentary Hierarchies and Superbubbles II: Impact of superbubbles and galactic dynamics on filament formation and fragmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22326)

**Authors:** Rachel Pillsworth, Ralph E. Pudritz, Eric W. Koch, Theo J. O'Neill
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

This paper investigates how galactic shear, supernovae, superbubbles, and magnetic fields influence the formation and stability of filamentary structures in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy. The authors use filament and superbubble analysis codes to study these effects. They find that local shear has minimal impact on filament stability, with larger structures at outer disk radii more likely to be disrupted by shear than supernovae. Filaments are predominantly aligned with magnetic fields, which significantly stabilize them. Filaments with a surface-to-central pressure ratio ($\chi_f$) of less than or equal to 1 are gravitationally supercritical and more stable, while those with $\chi_f > 1$ are transient or forming. The study also reveals that ISM pressure affects filament stability and star formation rates differently in the inner versus outer regions of the disk. This research provides insights into the complex interplay of forces shaping star-forming regions in spiral galaxies.

**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

This study explores the connection between dust-rich regions and hot X-ray emitting gas in a sample of group-centered elliptical galaxies, focusing on the role of AGN feedback. The researchers used multi-wavelength data, including H-alpha and CO emission detected by MUSE and ALMA, to analyze the physical and kinematic properties of these regions. They found that dust clouds containing molecular gas are preferentially located at the rims of X-ray cavities, suggesting that AGN-driven outflows enhance the condensation of cold, dusty gas at these interfaces. Additionally, spatial variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv indicate smaller dust grains in regions where dust, CO, and H-alpha emissions coincide, contrasting with larger grains elsewhere. This suggests grain growth or survival mechanisms within shielded cold gas. The findings provide insights into the multiphase medium arising from AGN feedback and its impact on dust grain characteristics.

### [The Environmental Switch in Black Hole Feeding: Bar-Driven vs. Merger-Driven Growth in IllustrisTNG50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22875)

**Authors:** Harsh Uttam, Sandeep Kumar Kataria
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

The study investigates how supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth is influenced by different mechanisms—secular processes like bar formation versus galaxy mergers—across varying environments using the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. The researchers tracked the timing of bar formation and mergers in both isolated and non-isolated galaxies to understand their impact on SMBH fueling. They found that in isolated barred galaxies, early-formed bars sustain coherent accretion phases, regulating late-time SMBH growth. Conversely, in non-isolated galaxies, early merger-driven accretion dominates, with bars forming later and contributing minimally to primary growth. This highlights an environmental bifurcation in SMBH fueling pathways, with mergers triggering early growth in active systems and bars sustaining prolonged accretion in quiescent discs. This work provides a unified framework linking environment, disc dynamics, and SMBH growth, offering insights into the complex interplay of factors driving SMBH evolution.

### [Correlated residuals in Tully-Fisher and Fundamental Plane relations and their impact on peculiar velocity measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23033)

**Authors:** Tyann Dumerchat, Raul E. Angulo, Julian Bautista, Cesar Aguayo, Sownak Bose, Lars Hernquist
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

The Tully-Fisher (TF) and Fundamental Plane (FP) relations are crucial for measuring extragalactic distances and peculiar velocities, which are essential for understanding large-scale cosmic flows and cosmological parameters. This study uses the Millennium-TNG hydrodynamical simulation to evaluate the accuracy of TF and FP methods in the presence of realistic galaxy formation physics. The key finding is that while these methods reliably infer 2-point velocity statistics on scales larger than ~10 Mpc/h, significant systematic deviations occur on smaller scales due to spatially correlated residuals. These residuals are driven by correlations between galaxy structural properties, star-formation history, and local environment. The study shows that incorporating additional galaxy properties like star formation rate, gas mass, and stellar mass into the TF and FP relations can mitigate these environmental correlations, especially for late-type galaxies. This highlights the importance of accounting for galaxy formation physics to avoid biases in cosmological analyses based on peculiar velocity measurements.

### [Revisiting the Perseus Cluster III: Role of Aspherical Explosions on its Chemical Composition and Extension to Metal-Poor Stars and Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23356)

**Authors:** Shing-Chi Leung, Henry Yerdon, Seth Walther, Ken'ichi Nomoto, Aurora Simionescu
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

The paper investigates the role of aspherical explosions in shaping the chemical composition of the Perseus Cluster, extending the analysis to implications for metal-poor stars and galaxies. The authors use jet-induced explosion models to simulate detailed chemical profiles, capturing the production of odd-number elements and iron-group elements. They find that these aspherical explosions can better match observed elemental abundance ratios, particularly improving the Ni/Fe ratio. The study also explores the impact of collapsar models on galactic chemical evolution, demonstrating that collapsars are essential to explain elemental trends in the Milky Way, such as the Zn-enrichment in star HE 1327-2326. This work highlights the importance of considering aspherical explosions in understanding the chemical evolution of clusters and galaxies.

### [You can't see me: super-Eddington growth hindering X-ray detection in high-z broad-line AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22305)

**Authors:** Alessandro Trinca, Alessandro Lupi, Francesco Haardt, Piero Madau
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper investigates why many high-redshift broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) discovered by JWST are not detected in X-rays by Chandra. The authors use a combination of broad emission line analysis and non-detection data, applying a self-shadowed, super-Eddington accretion model with coronal over-cooling. They find that these AGNs likely host low-mass black holes ($\sim 10^{6}-10^{7} M_{\odot}$) accreting at very high rates ($f_{\rm Edd} \gg 1$), which explains the X-ray weakness. This suggests that these AGNs are rapidly growing super-Eddington black holes whose X-ray emissions are suppressed, challenging previous interpretations of their masses.

### [Identifying Evolutionary Stages of Molecular Clumps through Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22375)

**Authors:** K. V. Plakitina (Institute of Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia), M. S. Kirsanova (Institute of Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia), A. B. Ostrovskii (Ural Federal University named after the first President of Russia B.N.Yeltsin, Ekaterinburg, et al. (18 total)
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper explores the use of machine learning to classify the evolutionary stages of molecular clumps, which is essential for understanding star formation. Traditional methods often leave many sources unclassified due to ambiguous signatures or obscured infrared emissions. The authors applied unsupervised clustering with HDBSCAN on molecular line intensities from the MALT90 survey and Spitzer IR photometry, identifying distinct evolutionary stages using five molecular lines (HCO$^+$, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H). They found that C$_2$H and N$_2$H$^+$ emissions were key in distinguishing protostars and regions without active star formation. Supervised learning was then used to classify previously uncertain clumps, providing categories for 522 objects. This approach effectively uncovers intrinsic evolutionary structures in astrochemical data, offering a powerful complement to traditional classification methods.

### [VLBI Detections of Compact Nuclei in Spiral-hosted Double-lobed Radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (DRAGNs): Evidence for Weak Parsec-Scale Jet Activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22668)

**Authors:** Mingyu Ryu, Jae-Young Kim
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper investigates the presence of compact radio nuclei and parsec-scale jets in spiral-hosted double-lobed radio-loud active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs), a rare class that challenges the conventional view linking powerful jets to elliptical galaxies. Using public VLBI data archives, the authors identified compact cores in four sources and resolved jets in two, finding low brightness temperatures ($T_{\rm b} \approx 10^9$ K) and jet-to-counterjet ratios indicative of mildly relativistic speeds ($\beta \lesssim 0.6$). These observations suggest weakly powered outflows, supported by low radio-Eddington ratios ($\log(L_{\rm R,1.4\,GHz}/L_{\rm Edd}) \approx -5$ to $-8$). The findings imply recurrent or long-duty-cycle jet activity in these late-type hosts, highlighting the complexity of jet launching mechanisms in different galactic environments.

### [Redshift evolution of the Hubble constant: Constraints and new insights from an interacting dark energy model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22840)

**Authors:** Xinyi Dai, Yupeng Yang, Yicheng Wang, Yankun Qu, Shuangxi Yi, Fayin Wang
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper explores the redshift evolution of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) using an interacting dark energy (IDE) model to address the Hubble tension. The authors propose a modified IDE model where energy exchange between dark energy and dark matter induces a redshift dependence in $H_0$. They test this model against various observational data, including BAO from DESI DR2 and SDSS, cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon sample, and Planck CMB distance priors. The analysis reveals a decreasing trend of $H_0$ with redshift, supporting a power-law evolution beyond the standard ΛCDM model. Incorporating CMB data further tightens the constraints, indicating that the IDE framework offers a viable mechanism to describe the redshift evolution of $H_0$ and potentially alleviate the Hubble tension.

### [Cosmic voids as a probe of the nature of dark matter: simulations and galaxy survey forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22990)

**Authors:** Alexander Spencer London, Keir K. Rogers, Alex Lagu\"e, Ren\'ee Hlo\v{z}ek, Zara Zaman
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper explores how cosmic voids—regions in the universe with minimal galaxy density—can be used to probe the nature of dark matter, specifically focusing on ultra-light axions as a dark matter candidate. Using simulations and forecasts from upcoming galaxy surveys like DESI and Euclid, the authors find that axions suppress the formation of lower-mass halos, leading to larger voids and a reduced void-halo correlation. They predict that a Euclid-like survey can limit the axion energy density to less than 4.6% of dark matter at 95% credibility for an axion mass of \(10^{-25}\) eV, significantly improving current constraints. This work highlights the potential of cosmic voids as a powerful tool for understanding dark matter properties and suggests that combining void size function data with galaxy power spectrum data will be crucial for future analyses.

### [Imprints of primordial magnetic fields on the late-time Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23263)

**Authors:** Jennifer Schober, Molly Abramson, Sayan Mandal, Salome Mtchedlidze, Tina Kahniashvili
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

**Summary:**

- **Main Question:** The study investigates how primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) evolve during gravitational collapse in the early Universe and identifies the spatial scales where primordial signatures can persist.
- **Methodology:** The authors conducted high-resolution numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos, varying viscosity to explore different Reynolds-number regimes. They analyzed the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.
- **Key Finding:** At high Reynolds numbers, turbulence during collapse triggers a small-scale dynamo, amplifying magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and altering the magnetic energy spectrum. The dominance of dynamo amplification depends on the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time.
- **Significance:** The results emphasize the necessity of resolving the Jeans scale and turbulent inertial range in cosmological MHD simulations to accurately capture the interplay between gravitational compression and dynamo amplification, crucial for understanding which structures retain memory of primordial fields.
