### [Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). XXV. Large-scale environments of low-luminosity quasars at $z\sim6$ traced by Ly$\alpha$ emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11736)

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Low-luminosity quasars at $z\sim6$ exhibit diverse large-scale environments traced by Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters, with one object residing in a significant galaxy overdensity while three occupy normal fields, challenging the hypothesis that photoevaporative feedback drives the observed environmental diversity around high-redshift quasars.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Diverse environments in low-luminosity sample**: Of four quasars at $z\sim6.18$ with $-24<M_{1450}<-22$, only J0844$-$0132 resides in a significant LAE overdensity ($\delta_\mathrm{LAE}=3.77\pm0.97$), while the remaining three fields are consistent with average cosmic density.
- **Photoevaporation independence**: The detection of both overdense and normal environments around low-luminosity quasars—where photoevaporative effects are expected to be minimal—suggests that the diverse environments observed around bright quasars are not primarily caused by AGN feedback suppressing local galaxy formation.
- **JWST stellar mass comparison**: The LAE overdensity around J0844$-$0132 exceeds that of non-quasar galaxies with comparable stellar masses at $z\sim6$, while the other three quasar fields show overdensities comparable to inactive galaxies of similar mass, indicating that quasar activity does not necessarily correlate with enhanced large-scale structure.
- **Null correlation with host properties**: No significant correlation is found between LAE overdensity and host galaxy stellar masses or supermassive black hole properties (though the sample size is small).

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper type:** Observational imaging study with photometric redshift/density mapping.

**Methodology:** The study targets four low-luminosity quasars from the SHELLQs (Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars) survey at $z\sim6.18$. Large-scale environments are traced using Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) detected in narrowband NB872 ($\lambda_\mathrm{c}=872$ nm, $\Delta\lambda=56$ nm) imaging from the Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC). LAE overdensities are measured within the proximity zones of each quasar. Host galaxy stellar masses are derived from JWST observations, enabling comparison with control samples of inactive galaxies at similar redshifts and stellar masses.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **SHELLQs (Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars):** Parent survey providing the low-luminosity quasar sample at $z\sim6$.
- **Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC):** NB872 narrowband filter imaging for LAE selection.

- **LAE overdensity metric:** $\delta_\mathrm{LAE}$ measured relative to field-average LAE densities.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Expected massive environments:** High-redshift quasars are theoretically predicted to reside in massive dark matter haloes ($\sim10^{12-13} M_\odot$), implying they should trace galaxy overdensities; however, observational evidence has shown conflicting results ranging from dense protoclusters to underdense regions.
- **Photoevaporative feedback paradigm:** Bright quasars ($M_{1450}\lesssim-25$) emit intense ionizing radiation that may photoevaporate gas in their vicinity, potentially suppressing galaxy formation and creating an apparent underdensity of companion galaxies—a selection effect that complicates environment studies around luminous AGN.
- **Low-luminosity quasars as test cases:** Fainter quasars with lower ionizing luminosities ($-24<M_{1450}<-22$) provide a critical test of whether environmental diversity is intrinsic to the quasar host halo population or artificially induced by radiative feedback effects.

### [Evolution of submillimeter galaxies across cosmic-web environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11751)

**Authors:** Ankit Kumar, M. Celeste Artale, Antonio D. Montero-Dorta, Lucia Guaita, Joop Schaye, Kyoung-Soo Lee, Alexandra Pope, Facundo Rodriguez, et al. (15 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Using the FLAMINGO cosmological simulation, the authors demonstrate that submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) evolve from comprising ~30% of $M_* \geq 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ galaxies in dense cluster-halo environments at $z=4$ to only ~3% by $z=1$, while dominating the star formation budget (contributing up to 80%) in these regions at early cosmic epochs.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Strong environmental evolution of SMG fractions**: For galaxies with $M_* \geq 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, the SMG fraction in inner cluster-halo environments declines steeply from ~30% at $z=4$ to ~3% by $z=1$, with qualitatively similar trends observed across outer cluster-halo, filament, and void/wall environments.
- **Simulation methodology**: The study utilizes the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation combined with the DisPerSE algorithm to identify cosmic-web structures (filaments, cluster-halos, voids) at $z=4, 3, 2, 1.5,$ and $1$, validating that the simulation simultaneously reproduces observed SMG redshift distributions and number counts.
- **Distinct halo occupation behavior**: Unlike non-SMGs (whose relative abundance declines with increasing halo mass), the ratio of SMG halo occupation to total galaxy occupation is largely insensitive to halo mass but varies significantly with redshift; furthermore, the brightest SMGs ($S_{850} > 10$ mJy) are found exclusively in inner cluster-halos.
- **Dominance of early star formation in dense environments**: SMGs contribute up to 80% of the total star formation rate (SFR) in inner cluster-halos at $z=4$ (versus <50% in low-density regions), indicating they are the primary drivers of stellar mass assembly in protocluster environments during the peak epoch of cosmic star formation.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Simulation-based study:** The work employs the **FLAMINGO (Full LArge-scale structure and gravitational ModelIng of the cosmos with...)** cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to trace galaxy populations across cosmic time. The **DisPerSE (Discrete Persistent Structures Extractor)** algorithm identifies filamentary structures and defines five environmental classes: inner/outer cluster-halo, inner/outer filament, and void/wall, accounting for mass and density evolution across redshifts.

**Physical properties studied:** Stellar masses ($M_* \geq 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$), halo masses, submillimeter fluxes ($S_{850\mu m}$), gas metallicities, and star formation rates. The simulation successfully reproduces key SMG observations including redshift distributions and 850$\mu$m number counts.

- **Software**: Analysis performed using standard Python astronomical libraries (specific GitHub repositories not mentioned in abstract)

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Observational challenges**: SMGs are rare, luminous dusty star-forming galaxies whose scarcity makes it statistically difficult to establish robust environmental trends from observational surveys alone, necessitating large-volume simulations.
- **Environmental context**: The cosmic web (filaments, nodes, voids) plays a critical role in regulating galaxy formation, but the specific relationship between SMGs (tracers of extreme starburst activity) and large-scale structure remains debated, with some studies placing SMGs in protoclusters and others in the field.
- **SMG demographics**: Understanding whether SMGs are triggered by mergers, accretion, or secular processes requires knowledge of their host halo masses and local environmental densities across cosmic time, particularly during the peak of SMG activity at $z \sim 2-4$.

### [Simulation-Based Cosmological Mass Calibration of XXL Galaxy Clusters using HSC Weak Lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11989)

**Authors:** Sut-Ieng Tam, Keiichi Umetsu, Adam Amara, Dominique Eckert, Manon Regamey, Nicolas Cerardi, I-Non Chiu, Mauro Sereno, et al. (16 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Using a simulation-based inference framework (DELFI) to jointly model XXL cluster counts, X-ray observables, and HSC weak lensing, the authors constrain the cosmological parameter $S_8$ to $0.867 \pm 0.063$ while finding that the luminosity-temperature relation is steeper than self-similar predictions.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main cosmological result:** $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.867 \pm 0.063$, with an additional 3% systematic uncertainty from neural network stochasticity in the DELFI algorithm; this is consistent with Planck CMB constraints and recent cluster-based measurements
- **Methodology and sample:** Employs a 12-parameter forward model combining 171 XXL C1 clusters (abundance), 86 clusters in XXL-N (weak-lensing calibration), and 162 clusters with X-ray temperature/luminosity measurements; jointly fits cosmology and scaling relations while accounting for cluster miscentering, photometric redshift bias, and mass-dependent weak-lensing bias
- **Scaling relation tensions:** The temperature-mass relation is consistent with self-similar expectations, but the luminosity-temperature relation exhibits a significantly steeper slope than predicted by self-similar theory, suggesting stronger influence of non-gravitational physics (cooling/feedback) on luminosity than on temperature
- **Data products:** Provides self-consistent, lensing-calibrated mass estimates for all individual XXL clusters with measured X-ray temperatures or luminosities, enabling future multi-probe cosmological analyses

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
This is an **observational analysis** employing **simulation-based inference (SBI)**.

The study develops a forward model using the Density Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference (DELFI) algorithm to jointly constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Rather than assuming a Gaussian likelihood, DELFI uses neural density estimators to learn the posterior directly from simulations. The model incorporates the XXL survey selection function and generates mock populations of clusters with X-ray temperatures, luminosities, and weak-lensing shear profiles, comparing them to observed data from XMM-Newton and Subaru/HSC. Key systematic effects—including cluster miscentering offsets, photometric redshift biases in the lensing source galaxies, and mass-dependent weak-lensing calibration biases—are explicitly parameterized within the 12-dimensional model space.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | 171 (C1 abundance), 86 (WL calibration), 162 (with $T_X$/$L_X$) |
| Redshift range | Not explicitly stated; XXL C1 typically spans $z \lesssim 1.2$ |
| Key instruments | XMM-Newton (XXL survey); Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (SSP 3-year) |
| Data products | Individual cluster mass estimates; $S_8$ and scaling relation posteriors |
| Key reference | Tam et al. 2026 (this work); XXL survey definition (Pacaud et al. 2016) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **XXL Survey X-ray data:** http://xmm-lss.in2p3.fr/ (XXL survey database)
- **HSC SSP three-year shape catalog:** https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ (Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam SSP data release)
- **DELFI algorithm:** Density Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference method (likely implemented via `pydelfi` or similar neural posterior estimation package)
- **Forward modeling framework:** Custom SBI pipeline incorporating XXL selection function and cluster population synthesis

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Cluster cosmology requires self-consistent treatment of survey selection functions and mass-observable scaling relations; traditional likelihood-based methods struggle with the non-Gaussian distributions and complex selection effects inherent in X-ray cluster samples
- Weak lensing provides a direct mass calibration independent of cluster baryonic physics, but requires careful forward-modeling of systematic biases (miscentering, photometric redshift errors, shear calibration) to avoid biased constraints on $S_8$
- Simulation-Based Inference offers a flexible alternative to traditional MCMC for cluster cosmology, enabling joint modeling of cosmological parameters, astrophysical scaling relations, and observational systematics without requiring an analytic likelihood function

### [The connection between surface brightness and satellite systems for central galaxies through Illustris TNG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11257)

**Authors:** Silvio Rodriguez, Yamila Yaryura, Jose A. Benavides, Diego Garcia Lambas, Susana Pedrosa, Laura D. Baravalle, Laura Ceccarelli, Heliana E. Luparello, et al. (10 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Using the Illustris TNG-100 simulation, the authors demonstrate that low-surface-brightness galaxies host more numerous satellite systems in kinematic counter-rotation relative to their host discs compared to high-surface-brightness galaxies, suggesting LSBGs form through rotation-dominated accretion with minimal disruptive merger history.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Satellite excess in LSBGs**: LSBGs exhibit a continuous anti-correlation between central surface brightness and satellite number (particularly for massive centrals), hosting satellite populations with significantly larger velocity dispersions than high-surface-brightness galaxies (HSBGs) of equivalent stellar mass
- **Kinematic counter-rotation**: Satellite systems around LSBGs display systematic counter-rotation with respect to their host galaxy discs, contrasting with the kinematics typical of HSBG satellite systems; this relative tangential velocity correlates directly with host surface brightness
- **Halo property confirmation**: The simulation reproduces established observational trends where LSBGs occupy dark matter haloes with higher spin parameters and lower concentrations compared to HSBGs
- **[Claim requiring verification]** The authors propose that counter-rotating, rotation-dominated satellite kinematics indicate LSBGs have avoided the high merger rates that create radially anisotropic satellite orbits in high-surface-brightness systems; this causal connection between reduced merger history and low surface brightness represents a theoretical interpretation requiring observational validation

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Simulation-based study**

The analysis utilizes the Illustris TNG-100 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation (approximate box size 110 Mpc/h), the intermediate-resolution box of the IllustrisTNG project run with the moving-mesh code AREPO. The study focuses on central galaxies at z ≈ 0, divided into low-surface-brightness (LSBG) and high-surface-brightness (HSBG) populations based on stellar surface brightness thresholds.

**Physical properties studied:**
- Host halo spin parameters ($\lambda$) and concentration indices ($c_{200}$)
- Satellite stellar mass functions, spatial distributions, and projected number densities  
- Satellite kinematics: line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles and relative tangential velocities with respect to host disc angular momentum vectors
- Correlations between central galaxy surface brightness and satellite system angular momentum alignment (co-rotation vs. counter-rotation)

The simulation successfully reproduces observational constraints regarding the halo spin-concentration relationship for LSBGs, validating the use of TNG-100 for studying these diffuse systems. The study connects internal galaxy properties (surface brightness) with large-scale assembly tracers (satellite kinematics) within a $\Lambda$CDM framework.

- **Analysis tools**: Standard TNG analysis pipeline (Python-based tools for halo/galaxy catalog queries and kinematic measurements available via the TNG API); specific GitHub repositories or custom analysis codes are not mentioned in the provided abstract

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- The formation mechanism of low-surface-brightness galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology remains debated, specifically whether they represent "failed" analogs of normal galaxies or systems with distinct angular momentum acquisition and retention histories compared to high-surface-brightness populations
- Previous observational and simulation studies have established that LSBGs preferentially reside in dark matter haloes characterized by higher spin parameters and lower concentrations, suggesting that angular momentum content is a primary driver of surface brightness diversity
- Satellite kinematics (rotation-dominated vs. pressure-supported, co-rotating vs. counter-rotating) serve as fossil records of galaxy assembly history, distinguishing between angular-momentum-preserving cold accretion and disruptive major mergers that randomize satellite orbits and destroy disc coherence

### [BlastBerries: How Supernovae Affect Lyman Continuum Escape Fractions and Ionizing Photon Production in Local Analogs of High-Redshift Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11261)

**Authors:** Miranda Y. Kong, David O. Jones, Nicole E. Drakos, Sangeeta Malhotra, Kartheik Iyer, Brian C. Lemaux, Rohan P. Naidu, Thomas de Boer, et al. (19 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Supernova-hosting "Blueberry" galaxies exhibit bluer ultraviolet slopes (suggesting enhanced Lyman continuum escape channels) but significantly lower ionizing photon production efficiencies than their non-hosting counterparts, indicating that supernova feedback during cosmic reionization may simultaneously facilitate photon escape while suppressing the star formation that generates them.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Competing feedback signatures:** SN-hosting galaxies show a highly significant 7.9σ decrease in ionizing photon production efficiency (ξ_ion) but only a marginally significant (2.1σ) bluing of UV slopes compared to non-hosts, suggesting SN feedback reduces ionizing output while modestly enhancing escape pathways.
- **Suppressed explosion rates:** Among 1,242 Blueberry galaxies, only 11 supernovae were detected (10 core-collapse), implying a SN rate potentially lower than field galaxies of similar mass—though the authors caution that observational uncertainties and selection effects prevent definitive conclusions.
- **Distinct host demographics:** SN hosts display elevated star formation rates, higher stellar masses, and significantly burstier star formation histories over the last ~50 Myr compared to the broader Blueberry population.
- **Reionization implications:** The results support a "double-edged sword" model where SN feedback clears neutral gas channels for ionizing photon escape but simultaneously quenches star formation, potentially limiting the net ionizing output of compact galaxies during the epoch of reionization.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational study** utilizing cross-matched archival surveys to identify transient events in low-redshift analog populations and derive comparative galaxy properties through spectral energy distribution analysis and rate calculations.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | N = 1,242 BB galaxies; 11 SN hosts (10 CC SNe, 1 ambiguous) |
| Redshift range | z ≈ 0.01–0.05 (Blueberries; "even lower-redshift" than Green Peas at z~0.1–0.3) |
| Key instruments | SDSS (galaxy selection/properties), time-domain surveys (ZTF, ASAS-SN, ATLAS, Pan-STARRS for SN discovery), UV facilities (GALEX/HST/WFC3 for UV slopes and ionizing efficiency estimates) |
| Data products | Differential SN rates, stellar population synthesis fits (SFH burstiness), ξ_ion measurements, β-slope comparisons |
| Citation to note | Yang et al. (2017) for Blueberry definition; Izotov et al. series for Green Pea LyC escape studies |

**Methodology highlights:** The authors cross-matched the Blueberry catalog against transient discovery reports to identify SN hosts, then performed differential analysis of host versus non-host populations using stellar population synthesis to constrain recent star formation activity (~50 Myr timescales) and measured UV spectral slopes (β) as proxies for LyC escape fraction.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- Blueberry galaxy catalog (SDSS DR-based selection; Yang et al. 2017 criteria)
- Transient discovery databases (likely ZTF DR, ASAS-SN, ATLAS, Pan-STARRS1)
- Stellar population synthesis codes (implied for SFH reconstruction and ξ_ion derivation; possibly Prospector, Bagpipes, or similar)
- [No specific GitHub repositories or data release URLs provided in abstract]

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Compact, low-mass star-forming galaxies (Green Peas and their lower-redshift counterparts, Blueberries) serve as critical local laboratories for high-redshift physics, sharing similar specific star formation rates, metallicities, and morphologies with galaxies dominating cosmic reionization at z > 6.
- The physical mechanisms enabling Lyman continuum (LyC) escape remain poorly constrained; supernova feedback represents a leading hypothesis for creating low-density "channels" or clearing neutral gas cover fractions to allow ionizing photon escape.
- Ionizing photon production efficiency (ξ_ion) and escape fraction (f_esc) are decoupled observables that together determine the reionization photon budget, with feedback processes potentially regulating them in opposing directions—enhancing f_esc while suppressing ξ_ion through rapid quenching.

### [The Curious Case of Centaurus A II: On the Subject of the Quenched satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11270)

**Authors:** Sachi Weerasooriya, Mia Sauda Bovill, Matthew A. Taylor, Andrew J. Benson, Cameron Leahy, Alexis Vazquez, Niusha Ahvazi, Pamela M. Marcum, et al. (9 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in Centaurus A suppresses star formation in its inner satellite population, explaining the observed deficit of bright dwarf galaxies within 150 kpc that standard cosmological models overpredict by a factor of four.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **AGN feedback resolves the inner satellite deficit**: AGN-driven thermal feedback operating at $z < 5$ truncates the bright end of the inner luminosity function, reconciling the factor of $4 \pm 1$ overprediction of luminous satellites ($M_V < -15.8$) within 150 kpc seen in fiducial models
- **Spatial correlation with radio structure**: The satellite deficiency is spatially coincident with Centaurus A's massive, kiloparsec-scale radio lobes, suggesting a direct environmental link between the host AGN activity and satellite quenching
- **Alternative mechanisms ruled out**: Enhanced tidal disruption, reionization quenching, and suppressed intergalactic medium accretion alone cannot explain the observed deficit; the effect is not attributable to statistical variance or small-number statistics
- **Broader implications for satellite formation**: The results suggest that AGN feedback in massive hosts can regulate the survival and evolution of dwarf satellite populations beyond the Local Group, extending the observable influence of AGN to satellite luminosity functions

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

This is a **simulation-based** study employing semi-analytic modeling techniques.

The authors utilize the **Galacticus semi-analytic model (SAM)** applied to high-resolution **N-body merger trees** to model the satellite population of Centaurus A. The investigation focuses on the inner 150 kpc region, examining satellite luminosity functions, star formation histories, and radial distributions. The study tests several physical quenching scenarios: enhanced tidal disruption, reionization suppression, reduced IGM accretion, and AGN-driven thermal feedback.

The fiducial Galacticus models—calibrated to reproduce the Milky Way satellite population—successfully match the **global** satellite population of Cen A but systematically fail in the inner regions, overpredicting the number of bright satellites ($M_V < -15.8$) by a factor of $4 \pm 1$. The addition of **AGN thermal feedback at $z < 5$** significantly suppresses star formation in satellites entering the inner halo, effectively truncating the bright end of the luminosity function and bringing the simulations into agreement with observations.

**Key simulation references**: Galacticus (Benson et al. 2010, 2012; Benson 2012, *New A*, 17, 175).

- **Note**: The specific N-body simulation suite (e.g., ELVIS, Via Lactea II, or Cen A-specific zoom simulations) used to generate merger trees is not specified in the available abstract

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- Centaurus A presents a specific cosmological puzzle where its global satellite population aligns with $\Lambda$CDM expectations, yet its inner regions ($d < 150$ kpc) exhibit a significant deficit of luminous satellites compared to theoretical predictions—the "Curious Case of Centaurus A"
- The spatial correlation between the satellite deficiency and the galaxy's massive radio lobes suggests that environmental quenching mechanisms beyond standard tidal stripping and reionization suppression may be operating in massive elliptical hosts
- Standard semi-analytic models calibrated to the Milky Way fail to reproduce the Cen A inner satellite population without incorporating additional physics specifically modeling AGN feedback, indicating that feedback mechanisms may vary with host galaxy properties or that AGN feedback has been previously underestimated in satellite quenching models

### [First statistical constraints on galactic scale outflows properties traced by their extended Mg II emission with MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11280)

**Authors:** Ismael Pessa, Lutz Wisotzki, Tanya Urrutia, Nicolas F. Bouch\'e, Floriane Leclercq, Ramona Augustin, Yucheng Guo, Daria Kozlova, et al. (10 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
This paper presents the first statistical analysis of Mg II-emitting circumgalactic halos around 47 star-forming galaxies at $z=0.7$–2.0, revealing that outflow kinematics, geometry, and opacity correlate with host galaxy stellar mass and hint at distinct physical mechanisms powering compact versus extended halos.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **First population-level constraints:** The study statistically characterizes Mg II outflows in a sample of 47 galaxies, detecting extended emission out to $\sim$20 kpc with a characteristic half-light radius (HLR) peaking at $\sim$5 kpc—overcoming previous limitations of single-object studies.
- **Mass-dependent kinematics and geometry:** Outflows accelerate linearly from launching velocities of $\sim$60 km/s to maximum velocities up to $\sim$490 km/s that scale with stellar mass; low-mass galaxies show exclusively wide opening angles, while massive galaxies display a bimodal distribution of both wide and narrow angles.
- **Decoupled size-mass relation:** Compact halos (HLR $<8$ kpc) correlate with stellar mass, but extended halos do not, suggesting fundamentally different powering mechanisms (e.g., starburst-driven winds vs. sustained AGN feedback or mergers) for the two populations.
- **High-opacity central regions:** The inner outflow regions are highly opaque, with a tentative trend indicating increasing central optical depth in more massive galaxies, consistent with denser launch conditions in massive hosts.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational study** utilizing deep integral field spectroscopy to map faint circumgalactic Mg II emission.

**Methodology:**
- **Targets:** 47 star-forming galaxies selected at $0.7 < z < 2.0$ where Mg II $\lambda\lambda$2796,2803 falls in the MUSE wavelength coverage.
- **Observables:** Extended Mg II emission line morphology (half-light radius), kinematic maps (velocity, velocity dispersion), and line ratios constraining optical depth.
- **Modeling:** Analytical framework treating outflows as ensembles of radially accelerating, geometrically thin shells with parameterized velocity laws, opening angles, and optical depths—extended from the authors' previous single-object study to a statistical sample.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **Observations:** Deep MUSE (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) observations at the Very Large Telescope (VLT)
- **Modeling code:** Custom shell-model outflow framework (extended from previous work; specific repository not mentioned in abstract)
- **Data availability:** Not specified in abstract; likely proprietary MUSE data or available through ESO archive

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- The circumgalactic medium (CGM) serves as the gas reservoir regulating galaxy growth, with Mg II absorption and emission tracing cool ($T \sim 10^4$ K) gas phases in large-scale outflows, yet statistical constraints on outflow geometry and kinematics have been limited by the surface brightness limits of previous instrumentation.
- While star-formation-driven winds are theoretically predicted to scale with galaxy properties, the connection between host galaxy stellar mass/SFR and the spatial extent, velocity structure, and covering fraction of cool outflows remains observationally uncertain at intermediate redshifts.
- Previous Mg II emission studies were restricted to single-object deep exposures or stacked analyses, preventing robust constraints on population variance in outflow opening angles and opacity profiles.

### [The "bubbly" interstellar medium as origin for the inhomogeneous internal metallicity distributions in large disk galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11450)

**Authors:** Benjamin Metha, Michele Trenti, Colin Norman
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

The authors demonstrate that small-scale metallicity inhomogeneities in local disk galaxies originate from metal-enriched superbubbles (φ ≈ 300 pc) created by spatially correlated core-collapse supernovae, revealing that massive local galaxies remain intrinsically bursty on small scales despite appearing steady when averaged over large areas.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **Main result:** A superbubble model successfully reproduces observed metallicity fluctuations with characteristic radius φ ≃ 300 pc (set by the disk scale height) and star formation efficiency ε = 0.1–0.2 within bubble regions, quantified via geostatistical forward-modelling of ~0.05 dex metallicity variations on hundred-parsec scales.
- **Methodology:** Analysis of 2D metallicity maps from the PHANGS-MUSE survey using geostatistical forward-modelling to constrain the physical scale and enrichment amplitude of fluctuations; theoretical framework posits that superbubbles expand until shock breakout at the disk scale height, after which metals preferentially enrich the perpendicular direction.
- **Unexpected implication:** Large local disk galaxies that appear to have steady, regular star formation when averaged over kiloparsec scales remain fundamentally bursty on small scales (≲300 pc), behaving analogously to their high-redshift counterparts rather than representing a distinct, quiescent mode of star formation.
- **Broader impact:** The degree of ISM inhomogeneity scales with global galaxy properties (via disk scale height), indicating that local ISM structure is not universal and resolving the long-standing tension between observations of chemically inhomogeneous gas and analytical models predicting efficient mixing.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Study type:** Observational analysis with theoretical interpretation/forward-modelling.

**Methodology:** The study analyzes resolved metallicity maps from integral field spectroscopy to measure the characteristic scale and amplitude of spatial fluctuations. The theoretical model proposes that metal-enriched superbubbles expand until reaching the galaxy's disk scale height (setting the correlation length φ), with the metallicity enhancement amplitude proportional to the star formation efficiency (ε) in clustered stellar populations. A geostatistical forward-modelling approach compares observed metallicity variance against synthetic maps generated from the superbubble model.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- **The metallicity mixing problem:** Resolved observations reveal significant small-scale metallicity variations (~0.05 dex on hundred-parsec scales) in local disk galaxies, contradicting classical analytical chemical evolution models that assume efficient mixing and predict a chemically homogeneous ISM.
- **Superbubble physics:** Large-scale supernova feedback creates superbubbles—cavities of shock-heated, metal-enriched gas—whose expansion is governed by the ambient density structure; shock breakout at the disk scale height fundamentally shapes the geometry of metal redistribution.
- **The steady vs. bursty paradigm:** Galaxy evolution models often distinguish between "steady" star formation in massive local disks and "bursty" formation in high-redshift or dwarf galaxies; this framework challenges that dichotomy by showing that apparent steadiness may be an averaging artifact hiding small-scale burstiness.

### [The faint end of the UV luminosity function at $0.4 < z < 0.7$ from the Hubble Frontier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11681)

**Authors:** Lei Sun, Xiao-Lei Meng, Xin Wang, Hu Zhan, Anahita Alavi, Nicha Leethochawalit, Brian Siana, Hang Zhou, et al. (10 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

Using deep HST UV imaging of the strongly lensing cluster Abell 2744, this work measures the faint-end slope of the galaxy UV luminosity function at $z \sim 0.55$ down to $M_{UV} \approx -12$, finding $\alpha = -1.324^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$ and ruling out a luminosity turnover brighter than $M_{UV} = -15.5$ at $3\sigma$ confidence.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **Steep faint-end slope measured:** At $z \sim 0.55$, the best-fit Schechter function yields a faint-end slope of $\alpha = -1.324^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, extending measurements to $M_{UV} < -13.5$ mag and bridging the gap between flat local ($z\sim0$) and steep high-redshift ($z>2$) UV luminosity functions.
- **Ultra-faint sample via gravitational lensing:** The study identifies 152 galaxies spanning $-19.5 < M_{UV} < -12.1$ at $0.4 < z < 0.7$ using HST WFC3/UVIS F225W imaging (Cycle 27 GO-15940) combined with the magnification boost from the Abell 2744 foreground cluster, enabling detection $\sim$2–3 magnitudes fainter than blank-field limits.
- **Constraint on faint-end turnover:** By incorporating a curvature parameter $\delta$ in the maximum likelihood estimation, the analysis rules out a turnover in the UV luminosity function brighter than $M_{UV} = -15.5$ at $>3\sigma$ confidence, suggesting the galaxy population continues to rise toward very faint luminosities without a detected cutoff.
- **Critical epoch for reionization budget:** These constraints at intermediate redshift ($z\sim0.55$) provide essential calibration points for models tracking the evolution of dwarf galaxy populations and their contribution to cosmic star formation and reionization.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper type:** Observational

**Methodologies:** The study utilizes new deep F225W ($\sim$2300Å rest-frame at $z\sim0.55$) observations from HST program GO-15940, combined with archival Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) data for the Abell 2744 field. Strong gravitational lensing magnification from the massive foreground cluster enables detection of ultra-faint galaxies. Redshifts are determined via hybrid photometric-spectroscopic selection. The luminosity function is derived using maximum likelihood estimation with a modified Schechter function that includes a curvature term $\delta$ to explicitly test for a faint-end turnover. A 50% completeness limit is applied to define the reliable sample.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- **Evolution of the faint-end slope:** The UV luminosity function exhibits a steep faint-end slope at high redshift ($\alpha \sim -1.6$ to $-2.0$ at $z>2$) that appears to flatten toward the local universe ($\alpha \sim -1.1$ to $-1.3$ at $z\sim0$), but the transition redshift and driving physical mechanisms (feedback, dust, gas accretion) remain poorly constrained due to lack of deep data at intermediate redshifts.
- **The turnover controversy:** Theoretical models and some observational claims suggest the luminosity function may turnover (truncate) at very faint magnitudes ($M_{UV} > -14$), which would significantly reduce the contribution of dwarf galaxies to the cosmic UV emissivity and reionization photon budget; testing this requires lensing-aided observations to reach the necessary depth.
- **Cluster lensing as a probe:** Massive galaxy clusters in the HFF provide the only currently feasible method to study galaxies at $M_{UV} > -15$ at $z>0.4$, as blank-field surveys are surface-brightness limited; however, lensing introduces selection biases and magnification uncertainties that require careful modeling.

**Authors:** Clara L. Pollock, Kasper E. Heintz, Joris Witstok, Rashmi Gottumukkala, Gabriel Brammer, Sownak Bose, Alex J. Cameron, Pratika Dayal, et al. (26 total)
**Relevance Score:** 7.5/10

• **Context:** A surprising excess of UV-bright galaxies at cosmic dawn ($z>9$) challenges current models of early galaxy formation.

• **Methods:** Using JWST/NIRSpec Prism spectroscopy, the authors modeled damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption features to measure neutral hydrogen (HI) column densities and star formation properties in galaxies confirmed at $z>9$.

• **Key finding:** These galaxies contain dense HI gas that drives extremely efficient star formation, with gas depletion times of only 10–100 Myr—far exceeding the local Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and theoretical predictions.

• **Implications:** The combination of rapid gas consumption and low dust obscuration naturally explains the observed UV luminosities, providing the first robust observational constraints on how pristine neutral gas assembles onto galaxies at the onset of reionization.

### [A Portrait of the Cosmic Reionisation History in the Context of the Early Dark Energy Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11068)

**Authors:** Weiyang Liu, Xin Wang, Hu Zhan, Karl Glazebrook, Mengtao Tang, Michele Trenti
**Relevance Score:** 7.5/10

• **Problem:** JWST observations reveal rapid cosmic reionization within the first ~700 million years and unexpectedly abundant high-redshift galaxies, which standard ΛCDM struggles to explain without invoking extreme astrophysical conditions—specifically, very high ionizing photon escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc} \gtrsim 0.2$) or dominant contributions from ultra-faint galaxies.

• **Approach:** The authors model the reionization history using the Early Dark Energy (EDE) cosmological framework, which was originally proposed to resolve the Hubble tension and naturally predicts higher galaxy number densities at early times without requiring extreme star formation efficiencies.

• **Key Result:** The EDE paradigm successfully reproduces observed reionization constraints while requiring only moderate parameters: ionizing photon escape fractions of merely 0.05–0.1 and UV luminosity densities from brighter galaxies ($M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -17$ to $-15$), avoiding the extreme scenarios necessitated by standard cosmology.

• **Significance:** These findings suggest that the detailed history of cosmic reionization could serve as an independent and complementary probe of EDE cosmologies, offering a new observational pathway to test models designed to resolve the Hubble tension while accommodating JWST's early universe discoveries.

### [Tailored mass estimators for Milky Way dwarf Spheroidals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11273)

**Authors:** Sofia L. Splawska, Rapha\"el Errani, Jorge Pe\~narrubia, Matthew G. Walker
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

Standard dynamical mass estimates for dwarf spheroidal galaxies assume rigid stellar density profiles, potentially biasing results given that velocity dispersion depends on profile shape. By fitting flexible density models to Milky Way dSph satellites and propagating profile-shape uncertainties through the virial theorem, the authors quantify how observational diversity affects mass measurements. They find that structural variations across the dSph population induce systematic errors up to factors of 10 in conventional estimators, significantly revising dynamical scaling relations such as enclosed mass versus stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation.

**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

• **The Problem:** Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are hypothesized to quench star formation, yet powerful AGN are rarely observed in local galaxies undergoing this transition (z < 0.2), raising questions about their actual role.

• **The Approach:** The authors compare multiwavelength AGN tracers—X-ray (eROSITA), mid-infrared (WISE), and radio (FIRST)—across post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), star-forming galaxies, and quiescent galaxies, using stacking to probe faint, undetected sources.

• **The Result:** PSBs do not display significantly enhanced AGN emission compared to mass- and redshift-matched controls. While PSBs exhibit twice the mid-infrared AGN incidence of star-forming galaxies, their AGN luminosities are weak, and their radio and X-ray emission are consistent with star formation rather than AGN activity.

• **The Implication:** These findings suggest that AGN feedback at low redshift is likely subtle and “preventive” (maintaining quiescence) rather than violent and “ejective” (rapidly expelling gas), indicating that AGN may not be the dominant driver of the rapid quenching phase.

**Authors:** Daniel Green, Jiashu Han, Benjamin Wallisch
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

• **Problem:** How do direct couplings between the inflaton and additional fields during inflation alter primordial non-Gaussianity? This work identifies novel scaling regimes where signals exhibit mixed light and heavy field characteristics, extending standard cosmological collider physics.

• **Method:** These signatures imprint as oscillatory modulations in the scale-dependent bias of the galaxy power spectrum, which the authors search for using large-scale structure data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12).

• **Result:** While no signal is detected, the analysis places the first constraints on this extended parameter space of oscillatory non-Gaussianity, demonstrating significantly improved sensitivity over comparable non-oscillatory scenarios.

• **Significance:** The findings establish a new, observationally accessible window into ultra-high-energy physics that is particularly promising for detection in near-term galaxy surveys.

### [Evidence for Shallow Nebular Attenuation Curves and Patchy Dust Geometry at z~2 with Pa-beta/H-alpha Measurements from JWST-MegaScience Medium Band Photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11418)

**Authors:** Brian Lorenz, Katherine A. Suess, Mariska Kriek, Sedona H. Price, Joel Leja, Hakim Atek, Abhiyan Barailee, Rachel Bezanson, et al. (28 total)
**Relevance Score:** 6.5/10

This work investigates the wavelength dependence and spatial distribution of dust attenuating nebular emission in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon (z~2). Using JWST/MegaScience medium-band photometry, the authors measure H-alpha and Pa-beta lines for 209 galaxies across a wide mass range, finding that the Pa-beta/H-alpha ratio increases strongly with stellar mass. Their results favor a shallow nebular attenuation curve over the standard Milky Way law and show no correlation between dust attenuation and galaxy inclination, indicating that dust is patchy and clumpy rather than a uniform screen. This implies that standard dust corrections may underestimate nebular extinction by up to one magnitude in massive galaxies, significantly affecting inferred star formation rates and highlighting the power of JWST medium bands for statistical studies of dust properties.

**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

- **Problem:** Accurately reconstructing maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect is complicated by astrophysical contaminants, particularly the cosmic infrared background (CIB) and cosmic microwave background (CMB), which must be separated from the Compton-$y$ signal.
- **Method:** Using a linear combination pipeline, the authors combine two years of SPT-3G data with Planck satellite observations to produce a suite of Compton-$y$ maps that explore different trade-offs between statistical sensitivity and foreground suppression.
- **Results:** Validation through auto- and cross-power spectra with large-scale structure tracers, as well as stacking on known cluster locations, confirms robust recovery of the tSZ signal across the 1,500 square-degree survey field with well-characterized levels of noise and residual foregrounds.
- **Significance:** These high-resolution, low-noise maps provide a critical tool for future cosmological studies, including measurements of the tSZ power spectrum, cross-correlations with galaxy surveys, and detailed modeling of the thermodynamic state of baryons in galaxy clusters.

### [Probing baryonic feedback with fast radio bursts: joint analyses with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12174)

**Authors:** Amy Wayland, David Alonso, Robert Reischke
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

- **Background:** Uncertainties in baryonic feedback suppress small-scale matter clustering, degrading cosmological constraints from weak lensing (WL) surveys.
- **Approach:** Joint analysis of Stage-IV WL data and fast radio burst (FRB) dispersion measures, accounting for systematics like redshift errors and source clustering.
- **Key Result:** Combining WL and FRBs reduces the degradation factor on $S_8$ by $\sim$80% compared to WL alone; WL measurements break degeneracies between baryonic parameters that FRBs alone cannot separate.
- **Significance:** This offers a robust pathway to self-calibrate baryonic effects and recover unbiased cosmological information from upcoming WL surveys.

### [Reionization Bubbles from Real-Space Cross Correlations of Line Intensity Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12277)

**Authors:** Emilie Th\'elie, Sarah Libanore, Yonatan Sklansky, Julian B. Mu\~noz, Ely D. Kovetz
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

• **Background**: Directly imaging ionized bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization is complicated by foreground contamination and observational challenges at high redshift.
• **Method**: The authors propose using the real-space cross-correlation between 21-cm and star-forming line-intensity maps to reconstruct the bubble size distribution.
• **Results**: This correlation departs from saturation when bubbles of radius $r$ begin forming, then evolves from positive to negative values, reaching maximum anti-correlation when bubbles of that size peak in abundance.
• **Implications**: This provides a robust, complementary probe to Fourier-space analyses, directly linking the localized spatial structure of bubbles to the sources driving reionization.

### [Tango of Titans: Centaurus A and M83 as a Local Group Analog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11268)

**Authors:** David Benisty, Noam Libeskind, Dmitry Makarov
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

Despite heliocentric velocities that do not obviously indicate mutual attraction, this study investigates whether Centaurus A and M83 constitute a gravitationally bound galaxy pair analogous to the Milky Way and Andromeda in the Local Group. Using the Timing Argument calibrated with galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, the authors model the system dynamics under the assumption that line-of-sight motion reflects infall toward the barycenter. The analysis yields a total mass of $(6.36 \pm 1.30) \times 10^{12}\, M_\odot$, confirming that the galaxies are indeed bound and infalling, consistent with independent virial and luminosity estimates. This establishes the CenA/M83 system as the nearest compelling analog to the Local Group, providing a unique local laboratory for studying massive galaxy pair dynamics and interactions.

### [The Quasar Proximity Effect as an Alternative Probe of Quasar Pair Distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11269)

**Authors:** Huanqing Chen, Camille Avestruz, Jakob Wiest
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

High-redshift quasar pairs are promising precursors to supermassive black hole mergers, but large uncertainties in their line-of-sight distances prevent precise three-dimensional characterization. This study proposes using synthetic quasar proximity zone spectra to constrain these separations, demonstrating that for small sky-plane offsets (10–100 pkpc), the method can easily distinguish between close (≲1 pMpc) and distant (≳1 pMpc) line-of-sight distances, achieving accuracies of ~0.2 pMpc for true separations ≥3 pMpc. Even for wider sky separations (~1 pMpc), the technique discriminates between separations above and below ~4 pMpc with ~0.5 pMpc uncertainty. This proof-of-concept establishes proximity zone spectroscopy as a viable independent probe of quasar pair geometries, providing a new avenue to trace early supermassive black hole growth and merger scenarios.

### [DeepRed: an architecture for redshift estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11281)

**Authors:** Alessandro Meroni, Nicol\`o Oreste Pinciroli Vago, Piero Fraternali
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

Current photometric redshift estimation methods face challenges in generalizing across diverse astronomical populations—from normal galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients—while avoiding costly spectroscopic follow-up. This study presents DeepRed, a deep learning framework that adapts modern computer vision architectures (including EfficientNet, Swin Transformers, and MLP-Mixer) to estimate redshifts directly from survey images. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both simulated and real data, reducing prediction errors by 46–55% on gravitationally-lensed systems and 5–27% on general galaxy samples compared to existing methods, while maintaining interpretability through SHAP-based localization. These results establish deep learning as a robust, scalable solution for precision redshift estimation in upcoming large-scale surveys like LSST and DESI.

### [Status of the $S_8$ Tension: A 2026 Review of Probe Discrepancies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12238)

**Authors:** Ioannis Pantos, Leandros Perivolaropoulos
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The parameter $S_8$ quantifies the amplitude of matter density fluctuations and exhibits a persistent discrepancy between early-universe CMB predictions and late-universe structure measurements. This review establishes a new 2026 CMB baseline ($S_8 = 0.836 \pm 0.012$) combining Planck, ACT DR6, and SPT-3G data, then compares it against weak lensing, cluster counts, and galaxy-galaxy lensing results from 2019–2026. The analysis reveals a striking bifurcation: DES Year 6 shows a significant $2.4\sigma$–$2.7\sigma$ tension with CMB, whereas KiDS Legacy agrees at $<1\sigma$, implicating survey-specific systematics—such as photometric redshift calibration and shear measurement pipelines—as major contributors to the observed discrepancies. These findings suggest that heterogeneous systematic effects in late-universe probes likely dominate over potential new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, though exotic extensions cannot yet be excluded.
