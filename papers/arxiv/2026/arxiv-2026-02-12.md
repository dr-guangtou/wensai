### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The paper presents the first X-ray-based observational stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) for central galaxies across three orders of magnitude in halo mass, revealing a peak in the SHMR near $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12}\,M_\odot$ and a decline at higher masses due to feedback processes.

### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- The SHMR peaks near $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12}\,M_\odot$ and declines at higher masses, indicating reduced efficiency of stellar mass growth in massive halos.
- The study uses halo masses derived from eROSITA eRASS1 X-ray data and BCG stellar masses based on SDSS photometry, covering a wide mass range from $10^{12}$ to $10^{15}\,M_\odot$.
- The results are consistent with previous observational studies across various methods, including weak lensing and X-ray analyses.
- Comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations show good agreement at low masses but reveal discrepancies at cluster scales, highlighting the sensitivity of BCG stellar growth to feedback prescriptions.

### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational:**
- **Key methodologies:** The study measures the SHMR by stacking X-ray spectra of optically selected groups to recover average halo gas temperatures, which are then converted to halo masses via the $M$-$T_X$ relation. BCG stellar masses are derived from SDSS photometry.

### [MAGNUS III: Mild evolution of the total density slope in massive early-type galaxies since z$\sim$1 from dynamical modeling of MUSE integral-field stellar kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10347)

**Authors:** Pritom Mozumdar, Michele Cappellari, Christopher D. Fassnacht, Tommaso Treu
**Relevance Score:** 9.1/10

### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The study finds that the total density profiles of massive early-type galaxies have become steeper over the last 6.5 billion years, indicating a mild evolution in their mass distribution.

### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- The total density profiles of intermediate-redshift ETGs ($z \sim 0.44$) are approximately isothermal with a median mass-weighted total density slope of $<\gamma_{\rm T}> = 2.19 \pm 0.01$, which is shallower than the local baseline of $<\gamma_{\rm T}> = 2.26 \pm 0.01$ at $z \sim 0.04$.
- The study utilized spatially resolved stellar kinematics from MUSE-DEEP spectroscopy and surface brightness models from HST imaging for a sample of approximately 200 ETGs over the redshift range $0.24 < z < 0.75$.
- The observed trend of steepening density profiles is robust against model assumptions and persists even when restricting the analysis to high-velocity dispersion systems ($\sigma_e > 150$ km/s).
- The findings suggest that dissipative processes, such as gas-rich accretion and mergers, play a significant role in the late-stage assembly of massive ETGs, challenging some cosmological simulations.

### [The metal-poor tail of the APOGEE survey I. Uncovering [Fe/H] < -2.5 stars from the inner Galaxy to the Magellanic Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10859)

**Authors:** M. Montelius, E. Starkenburg, H. Woudenberg, A. Angrilli Muglia, A. Ardern-Arentsen, A. Viswanathan, A. Bystr\"om, A. Helmi, et al. (12 total)
**Relevance Score:** 7.6/10

The paper "The metal-poor tail of the APOGEE survey I. Uncovering [Fe/H] < -2.5 stars from the inner Galaxy to the Magellanic Clouds" by Montelius et al. aims to identify extremely metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -2.5) in the APOGEE survey, which are challenging to analyze due to the scarcity of spectral lines. The authors used APOGEE's calibrated stellar parameters, focusing on stars with null metallicities but well-determined effective temperatures and surface gravities, combined with Gaia DR3 data and spectrophotometric distances to compute the orbits of these stars. They identified 289 very metal-poor red giant stars, including 16 candidates in the Magellanic Clouds, 14 confined to the inner Galaxy, and 13 inner Galaxy halo interlopers. This work is significant as it expands the known population of extremely metal-poor stars, providing valuable targets for future spectroscopic follow-up and enhancing our understanding of the early chemical evolution of the Galaxy.

**Authors:** Arnab Lahiry, Tanio D\'iaz-Santos, Jean-Luc Starck, Niranjan Chandra Roy, Daniel Angl\'es-Alc\'azar, Grigorios Tsagkatakis, Panagiotis Tsakalides
**Relevance Score:** 7.4/10

The paper "Deep and Sparse Denoising Benchmarks for Spectral Data Cubes of High-z Galaxies: From Simulations to ALMA observations" by Arnab Lahiry et al. addresses the challenge of denoising faint signals from high-redshift galaxies, which is crucial for understanding massive galaxy assembly beyond cosmic noon. The authors benchmark various denoising techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), sparse unsupervised representations with iterative soft thresholding (IST), and supervised deep learning with a 3D U-Net, on synthetic and real ALMA [C II] spectral data cubes. They find that while PCA and ICA provide marginal improvements, IST effectively reduces noise at moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) but can suppress emission at low SNRs. The U-Net outperforms IST on synthetic data but faces generalization challenges on real observations with complex morphologies not present in the training set. This study highlights the importance of choosing appropriate denoising methods based on data characteristics and underscores the need for physically-motivated training priors to improve the performance of deep learning models in astronomical applications.

### [Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Star Candidates in the Milky Way from J-PLUS and S-PLUS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10325)

**Authors:** Jihye Hong, Timothy C. Beers, Yang Huang, Jonathan Cabrera Garcia, Young Sun Lee, Vinicius M. Placco, Evan N. Kirby
**Relevance Score:** 7.2/10

This study addresses the identification of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the Milky Way using data from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) and the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). The authors construct a combined sample of approximately 6.4 million stars and identify around 105,000 CEMP candidates, significantly expanding the known population. They confirm that absolute carbon abundance separates CEMP stars into CEMP-no and CEMP-s groups and recover distinct morphological groups in the Yoon-Beers diagram, including the recently proposed Group IV. This work provides a valuable resource for future spectroscopic follow-up studies to better understand the origins of these stars and their role in Galactic evolution.

### [Optimizing Deep Learning Photometric Redshifts for the Roman Space Telescope with HST/CANDELS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10207)

**Authors:** Ashod Khederlarian, Brett H. Andrews, Jeffrey A. Newman, Tianqing Zhang, Biprateep Dey
**Relevance Score:** 6.8/10

The paper "Optimizing Deep Learning Photometric Redshifts for the Roman Space Telescope with HST/CANDELS" investigates the effectiveness of deep learning methods for estimating photometric redshifts (photo-$z$'s) using Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS data, aiming to improve accuracy for the Roman Space Telescope. The authors compare fully-supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised deep learning algorithms, introducing a novel semi-supervised model called PITA, which uses a three-part loss function to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. PITA outperforms other methods, including template-based and classical machine learning, by producing a smooth latent space that enhances photo-$z$ accuracy even with reduced training data. This approach is crucial for Roman, as it can leverage the vast amount of high-resolution imaging and limited redshift measurements to achieve precise photo-$z$ estimates for both faint and bright sources, significantly advancing studies of galaxy evolution and large-scale structure.

**Relevance Score:** 6.7/10

The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to directly image and characterize Earth-like exoplanets and their atmospheres, potentially detecting biosignatures and addressing the question of whether we are alone in the universe. The paper presents the first three Exploratory Analytic Cases (EACs), which are architectural concept designs used to assess the mission's science objectives and explore engineering parameters. These EACs cover observing strategies, error budget formulation, design formulations, trade studies, and lessons learned, and utilize an integrated modeling pipeline for multidisciplinary system-level analysis. The findings from these initial EACs set the stage for further exploration of the trade space and preparation for the baseline design that will support the Mission Concept Review (MCR), ultimately advancing our understanding of exoplanets and general astrophysics.

### [Beyond $\Lambda$CDM: fundamental constants as cosmological observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10987)

**Authors:** Dinko Milakovi\'c, John K. Webb
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

The paper "Beyond ΛCDM: fundamental constants as cosmological observables" by Dinko Milaković and John K. Webb addresses the ongoing cosmological tensions that challenge the ΛCDM model, questioning whether these tensions stem from systematic effects or flaws in the model itself. The authors propose using observational constraints on the spacetime variations of fundamental constants, particularly the fine-structure constant (α), as a novel approach to distinguish between competing cosmological models. They advocate for the use of the Many Multiplet method to measure α in absorption systems towards bright quasars and atomic doublets in galaxies, suggesting that a facility like the WST could generate over 100,000 new α measurements from quasars and a million from galaxies. This extensive dataset, when combined with other probes, would offer unprecedented constraints on physics beyond ΛCDM, potentially resolving current cosmological tensions and advancing our understanding of fundamental physics.

The study presents a comprehensive re-analysis of spectroscopic data from the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph, providing dynamical masses, mean metallicities, and metallicity dispersions for 67 systems with at least 10 member stars. A key finding is that satellite galaxies and globular clusters are distinct in their dynamical mass and mass-to-light ratios at a given stellar mass, with satellite galaxies showing a break in the stellar mass-metallicity relation near log M*/Msun = 4. This uniform dataset will enhance constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relation, improve J-factor estimates for dark matter searches, and prepare for the influx of new Milky Way satellites expected from upcoming surveys like LSST, Roman, and Euclid.

### [Beyond thermal approximations: Precise cosmological bounds on Axion-Like Particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11100)

**Authors:** Nicola Barbieri, Luca Caloni, Martina Gerbino, Massimiliano Lattanzi, Luca Visinelli
**Relevance Score:** 5.9/10

The paper "Beyond thermal approximations: Precise cosmological bounds on Axion-Like Particles" by Nicola Barbieri, Luca Caloni, Martina Gerbino, Massimiliano Lattanzi, and Luca Visinelli addresses the problem of deriving precise cosmological bounds on axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to leptons or photons. The authors use a full phase-space treatment to solve the momentum-dependent Boltzmann equation for ALP production from the primordial thermal plasma, allowing them to compute cosmological observables with non-thermal spectral distortions. Using data from Planck, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the South Pole Telescope, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, they obtain 95% credible limits on the ALP decay constant: \( f_a > 1.63 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 9.41 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( 8.06 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV} \) for ALPs coupled to electrons, muons, and taus, respectively, and \( g_{a\gamma} < 1.98 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{GeV}^{-1} \) for the ALP-photon coupling. These results highlight the importance of an exact phase-space treatment for robust cosmological bounds on ALP interactions, which is crucial for understanding the nature of these elusive particles and their potential impact on cosmology.

### [The metal-poor tail of the APOGEE survey II. Spectral analysis of Mg and Si in very metal-poor APOGEE spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10883)

**Authors:** M. Montelius, A. Angrilli Muglia, E. Starkenburg, C. Kobayashi, A. Ardern-Arentsen, F. Gran, P. Jablonka, N. Martin, et al. (12 total)
**Relevance Score:** 5.7/10

The paper addresses the challenge of analyzing H-band spectra for very metal-poor stars (Fe/H < -2.5) in the APOGEE survey, where traditional methods fail due to weak Fe lines. The authors developed a specialized pipeline to measure Mg and Si abundances, which are more prominent in these spectra, to estimate overall metallicities. They analyzed 327 stars, identifying five with unusually high [Si/Mg] ratios (>0.5), suggesting a connection to globular cluster stars and possibly specific supernova events. This work extends the metal-poor tail of APOGEE results by 0.6 dex, providing new insights into the chemical composition of these stars and their potential origins in dwarf galaxies like Sextans.

### [Cosmic-ray electron propagation in NGC 3044 from radio continuum observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10574)

**Authors:** Shengtao Wang, Xiaohui Sun, George Heald, Jiang-Tao Li, Chao-Wei Tsai, Judith Irwin, Theresa Wiegert, Jun Xu
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper investigates the transport of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) and the associated galactic wind in the star-forming edge-on galaxy NGC 3044, aiming to understand how matter is transferred from the disk to the halo. The authors used high-resolution radio continuum observations at 943 MHz from the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP), which provided sensitivity higher than previous observations. They found that CREs are advected outward from the disk with a velocity that increases with height in a power law, exceeding the escape speed beyond about 3 kpc, indicating a strong wind. Additionally, they identified a possible superbubble of radius around 3 kpc filled with soft X-ray emitting hot gas and surrounded by an HI shell and a bright Hα rim. These findings highlight the importance of radio continuum observations as a powerful tool for probing cosmic-ray-driven winds in normal star-forming spiral galaxies.
