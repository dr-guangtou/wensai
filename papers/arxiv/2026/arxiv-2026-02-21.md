### [Dynamical Modelling of Galactic Kinematics using Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17371)

**Authors:** David A. Simon, Michele Cappellari, Shude Mao, Jiani Chu, Dandan Xu
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The authors demonstrate that simple neural networks can be trained as surrogate models for Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM), accurately predicting the kinematics of early-type galaxies from photometry and model parameters while reducing computation time by orders of magnitude compared to traditional numerical integration.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Surrogate modelling success**: A relatively simple neural network architecture successfully reproduces JAM velocity and dispersion fields with high fidelity (errors typically < few percent inferred from context), achieving speed-ups of $10^2$–$10^3\times$ compared to traditional JAM calculations.
- **Training methodology**: The team generated a training set of JAM models covering early-type galaxy parameter space (varying anisotropy $\beta$, inclination $i$, mass-to-light ratios $\Upsilon$, and Sérsic indices), using 2D mock photometry alongside model parameters as network inputs.
- **Architectural insight**: Even "relatively simple" architectures (likely multi-layer perceptrons or shallow CNNs) suffice for this physical regression task, suggesting the mapping from photometry+parameters to kinematics is sufficiently smooth within the JAM framework.
- **[Flagged claim]**: While the abstract suggests this work moves toward relaxing assumptions (axisymmetry, velocity ellipsoid shape), the current implementation trains specifically on JAM outputs which inherently enforce these assumptions; the method is therefore a fast approximator of JAM rather than a generalization beyond its physical limitations.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Paper Type**: Simulation-based / Methodological (using JAM as numerical simulator to generate training data)

The study employs Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (Cappellari 2008) to generate ground-truth kinematic maps, treating the traditional code as an expensive simulator that the neural network learns to emulate.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Simulation method | Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) |
| Sample size | $\sim 10^4$–$10^5$ unique models (inferred from typical ML training requirements) |
| Redshift range | $z \approx 0$ (local early-type galaxies) |
| Galaxy types | Early-type (elliptical/lenticular); axisymmetric models |
| Input features | Mock photometry (2D surface brightness profiles) + 6–8 JAM parameters ($i$, $\beta$, $\Upsilon$, etc.) |
| Output features | 2D velocity fields $V(x,y)$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma(x,y)$ |
| Neural network | Multi-layer perceptron or shallow CNN (described as "relatively simple") |
| Speed improvement | $\sim 10^2$–$10^3\times$ faster than traditional JAM at inference |
| Key reference | Cappellari (2008) - JAM method foundation |

**Physical Model**: JAM assumes axisymmetry and parameterizes the velocity ellipsoid (typically constant anisotropy $\beta_z = 1 - \sigma_z^2/\sigma_R^2$ or Osipkov-Merritt profiles). The neural network learns the non-linear mapping from observable (photometry) and physical parameters to kinematic observables without solving the Jeans equations numerically at inference time.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **JAM software**: `jamPy` or original IDL implementation (Cappellari 2008, MNRAS) for generating training data
- **Neural network framework**: PyTorch or TensorFlow (specific package not stated in abstract)
- **Mock photometry generator**: Sérsic profile models with varying index $n$, effective radius $R_e$, and ellipticity $\epsilon$
- **Training data**: Custom synthetic dataset of JAM models (public availability not specified)
- **GitHub repository**: Not provided in available abstract

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Computational bottleneck**: Traditional dynamical modelling via Jeans methods requires expensive numerical integrations at every likelihood evaluation, making Bayesian parameter inference prohibitively slow ($\sim$hours per galaxy) for large surveys like ESO or future facilities.
- **Limitations of current models**: Standard JAM and similar methods enforce strict assumptions (axisymmetry, specific anisotropy profiles, and often constant mass-to-light ratios) that conflict with observed complexity in real galaxies (e.g., triaxiality, varying stellar populations, non-Gaussian velocity distributions).
- **ML surrogate models**: Emulators are emerging as solutions for expensive astrophysical computations (N-body, radiative transfer), but dynamical modelling presents unique challenges due to high-dimensional input spaces and the need to preserve physical constraints (e.g., phase-space consistency, positive distribution functions).

### [Varstrometry for Off-nucleus and Dual Subkiloparsec AGN (VODKA): Three Quadruply Lensed Quasars at Cosmic Noon in HST and JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16995)

**Authors:** Mingrui Liu, Yu-Ching Chen, Nadia L. Zakamska, Xin Liu, Yue Shen, Xuheng Ding, Arran Gross, Hsiang-Chih Hwang, et al. (10 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

This paper presents HST and JWST observations of three quadruply lensed quasars at cosmic noon ($z_{\rm source} \approx 1.5-3.0$) lensed by massive early-type galaxies at unusually high redshifts ($z_{\rm lens} \approx 0.4-1.5$) with small Einstein radii ($\sim$0.5"), filling a previously unexplored regime of subarcsecond strong lensing systems.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **Rare lens population identified**: Three new quadruply lensed quasar systems with source redshifts $z = 1.500, 2.550,$ and $2.975$, representing strong lenses at cosmic noon with lens galaxies constrained to $0.4 < z < 1.5$ (photometric only).
- **Distinctive lensing parameters**: The systems exhibit Einstein radii of $0.44''$, $0.58''$, and $0.49''$—at the lower end of known quadruple lenses—while occupying the upper end of lens redshift distributions, representing a rare subarcsecond-separation population.
- **Lens galaxy properties**: All three lenses are consistent with massive early-type galaxies hosting de Vaucouleurs light profiles ($n_{\rm Sérsic} \sim 4$) with effective radii $R_e \approx 1.5-3.5$ kpc, typical of strong lensing galaxies but at higher redshifts than the bulk of known lenses.
- **[Verification needed]**: The claim that these represent an "interesting quadrant" of unexplored parameter space relies on comparison to existing lens samples (e.g., SQLS, HSC, or SLACS); the small sample size ($N=3$) limits statistical conclusions about the underlying population distribution.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper type**: Observational (imaging and gravitational lens modeling)

**Methodology**: 
- **Targets**: Three quadruply imaged quasar candidates from the VODKA (Varstrometry for Off-nucleus and Dual Subkiloparsec AGN) survey/ program.
- **Data**: High-resolution imaging from HST and JWST (filters not specified in abstract).
- **Modeling**: Gravitational lens reconstruction assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass profile for the lensing potential and elliptical Sérsic profiles for the lens galaxy light distributions.
- **Measurements**: Einstein radii, lens galaxy structural parameters (effective radii, Sérsic indices), and photometric redshift constraints for the lens galaxies (in the absence of spectroscopic measurements).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | $N = 3$ quadruply lensed quasars |
| Source redshift range | $z = 1.500 - 2.975$ |
| Lens redshift constraints | $0.4 < z < 1.5$ (photometric) |
| Einstein radii | $\theta_E = 0.44'', 0.58'', 0.49''$ |
| Lens effective radii | $R_e \approx 1.5 - 3.5$ kpc |
| Lens Sérsic indices | $n \sim 4$ (de Vaucouleurs) |
| Key instruments | HST, JWST |
| Data products | Lens models, photometric redshifts, mass profiles |
| Survey context | VODKA program |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS

- **Archival data**: Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging archives; James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging data.
- **Software/Modeling tools**: Specific lens modeling software packages (e.g., lenstronomy, glafic, or custom MCMC codes) are not specified in the abstract; details likely in the main text.
- **Repository**: arXiv:2602.16995 (astro-ph.GA)

*[Note: Specific filter configurations, exposure times, and data release versions are not provided in the abstract and would be found in the main text or data availability statement.]*

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- **Population gap in lens samples**: Current strong lensing surveys (e.g., SQLS, DES, HSC) are biased toward larger Einstein radii ($\gtrsim 1''$) and lower lens redshifts ($z \lesssim 0.6$); subarcsecond-separation lenses with high-redshift deflectors remain underexplored due to resolution limits and selection effects.
- **Cosmic noon lensing**: The redshift range $z \sim 1-3$ represents the peak of galaxy assembly and AGN activity; lenses at these epochs provide unique laboratories for studying massive galaxy structure and dark matter profiles during the dominant phase of galaxy growth.
- **VODKA survey science**: The program leverages high-precision astrometry (varstrometry) and high-resolution imaging to identify off-nucleus and dual subkiloparsec AGN, with strongly lensed quasars representing either contaminants or valuable byproducts of the search strategy for compact dual AGN systems.

### [Under Pressure: UV Emission Line Ratios as Barometers of AGN Feedback Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17039)

**Authors:** Elise Fuller, Sean D. Johnson, Jonathan Stern, Hsiao-Wen Chen, Ena Choi, Claude-Andr\'e Faucher-Gigu\`ere, Massimo Gaspari, Andy Goulding, et al. (19 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Analysis of HST/COS far-ultraviolet spectra from five low-redshift obscured quasars reveals that radiation pressure dominates the dynamics of narrow-line region clouds in 60% of AGN-driven outflows, while one system shows comparable contributions from hot wind pressure, favoring feedback models where radiation pressure or transient hot wind phases drive galactic-scale outflows.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Radiation pressure dominates the majority**: Three of five targets exhibit UV emission line ratios consistent with radiation pressure-dominated cloud dynamics; one target shows intermediate ratios indicating both radiation and hot wind pressure are dynamically important.
- **First statistical FUV sample**: This study provides the first multi-object far-ultraviolet spectroscopic analysis of galactic-scale AGN outflows in obscured quasars, combining HST/COS observations with optical emission line diagnostics to constrain physical pressure models.
- **Potential luminosity dependence**: The lowest-luminosity object may be dominated by hot wind pressure rather than radiation pressure—counter to naive expectations—though non-detections prevent definitive classification. *[Note: This claim is tentative and requires verification given the non-detections.]*
- **Theoretical implications**: Results support AGN feedback scenarios mediated primarily by radiation pressure, or alternatively, a short-lived hot wind phase that dissipates after initially accelerating outflows rather than sustaining them over long timescales.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational Study**

The study employs ultraviolet spectroscopy to diagnose whether ionized clouds in AGN outflows are accelerated primarily by radiation pressure or by hydrodynamic pressure from hot winds. The authors compare observed narrow-line region (NLR) emission line ratios to theoretical models that parameterize the relative importance of these two pressure sources.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | N = 5 |
| Redshift range | Low-redshift (specific values not stated; typically z < 0.3 for COS studies of this type) |
| Target selection | Obscured quasars exhibiting galactic-scale outflows |
| Primary instrument | HST/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) |
| Complementary data | Optical emission line measurements (ground-based; specific facilities not stated) |
| Diagnostic method | Comparison of UV emission line ratios to theoretical pressure models |
| Physical regimes probed | Radiation pressure-dominated vs. hot wind-dominated cloud dynamics |

**Caveat**: Specific emission lines utilized (e.g., C IV, O III], Ne IV]) and quantitative threshold criteria for distinguishing pressure regimes are not specified in the available abstract.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **HST/COS Archive**: Far-ultraviolet spectroscopic observations retrieved from the [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://mast.stsci.edu/)
- **Theoretical Pressure Models**: Photoionization and shock models varying the ratio of radiation pressure to hydrodynamic pressure (specific modeling software such as CLOUDY or MAPPINGS not explicitly identified)
- **Optical Spectroscopic Catalogs**: Ground-based optical emission line measurements used in conjunction with UV data (specific surveys or programs not detailed)

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **AGN Feedback Mechanism Debate**: The astrophysical community debates whether AGN-driven outflows are primarily momentum-driven (radiation pressure on dusty ISM) or energy-driven (hot winds shocking/entraining cooler ISM), with significant implications for the efficiency of galaxy quenching and the fate of accreted energy.
- **Pressure Diagnostics via Emission Lines**: The ionization state and density structure of NLR clouds encode the dominant pressure source; UV transitions trace highly ionized species sensitive to the extreme radiation fields and shock velocities characteristic of AGN outflows.
- **Observational Gap**: Prior to this work, constraints on the relative importance of radiation versus hot wind pressure relied primarily on single-object case studies or optical diagnostics; systematic FUV investigations of obscured quasar outflows were lacking, preventing statistical assessment of feedback mechanisms across different AGN luminosities.

### [MIDIS: The identification of deep MIRI-red sources as candidates for extreme Balmer-break and line emitting galaxies at high-z](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17329)

**Authors:** I. Jermann, G. Brammer, S. Gillman, T. R. Greve, L. A. Boogaard, J. Melinder, R. A. Meyer, P. G. P\'erez-Gonz\'alez, et al. (30 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The deepest JWST/MIRI survey to date identifies seven rare "MIRI-red" galaxy candidates in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, consistent with extreme emission-line galaxies (rest-frame equivalent widths $\ge$750 Å) or high-redshift systems with strong Balmer breaks, including one extreme source requiring $EW_0 \sim 6000$ Å or a Balmer break of 6.3.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Detection sample and reliability:** Seven MIRI-red sources identified via a color cut of $m_{\rm F444W} - m_{\rm F560W} \ge 0.5$ in a 2.4 arcmin$^2$ field, with empirical estimates showing 92% purity and 54% completeness at a 5$\sigma$ detection limit of 28.75 mag (F560W).
- **Physical nature:** Colors are consistent with two distinct scenarios: (1) extreme emission-line galaxies with $EW_0({\rm H}\alpha) \ge 750$ Å or $EW_0({\rm H}\beta + [{\rm OIII}]) \ge 600$ Å, or (2) high-redshift ($z \sim 6$–9) galaxies featuring Balmer breaks of at least 1.6 mag, including one F115W dropout candidate.
- **Extreme outlier:** One "MIRI-only" galaxy undetected in F444W requires equivalent widths of $\sim$6000 Å (H$\alpha$) or $\sim$4000 Å (H$\beta$+[OIII]), or alternatively a Balmer break of 6.3 mag (suggesting a potential $z>10$ Little Red Dot analog or dusty galaxy).
- **Number density tension:** Observed counts are lower than predicted by extrapolations of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$+[OIII] line luminosity functions, and the absence of $z>10$ LRD candidates aligns with theoretical expectations given the MIDIS survey volume.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper type:** Observational imaging survey with photometric analysis and luminosity function comparison.

**Methodologies:** Deep imaging with JWST/MIRI F560W (5.6 μm) and NIRCam F444W/F115W in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field; empirical Monte Carlo simulations to estimate purity and completeness; color-color selection for "MIRI-red" classification; photometric redshift modeling to disambiguate emission-line versus Balmer-break scenarios; comparison against theoretical line luminosity functions and LRD volume densities.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Survey field | Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) |
| Survey area | 2.4 arcmin$^2$ |
| Sample size | 7 MIRI-red candidates |
| Detection significance | 5$\sigma$ |
| Depth (F560W) | 28.75 mag (AB) |
| Color selection | $m_{\rm F444W} - m_{\rm F560W} \ge 0.5$ |
| Purity @ 5$\sigma$ | 92% |
| Completeness @ 5$\sigma$ | 54% |
| Key instruments | JWST/MIRI (F560W), NIRCam (F444W, F115W) |
| Inferred redshift range | $z \sim 6$–9 (candidates), potential $z>10$ (extreme source) |
| Citation to note | Gillman et al. (MIDIS survey description; anticipated reference) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **MIDIS (MIRI Deep Imaging Survey):** Deepest JWST/MIRI F560W imaging in the HUDF (2.4 arcmin$^2$)
- **JWST archival data:** NIRCam F444W, F115W, and ancillary filters from existing Treasury programs in the HUDF
- **Analysis software:** [Likely includes] Source extraction (e.g., SExtractor, Photutils), photometric redshift codes (e.g., EAZY, LePhare, BPZ), and custom completeness simulations (specific repositories not detailed in abstract)

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- The ambiguity between high-redshift Balmer breaks and extreme emission-line contamination in broadband SEDs, specifically how the proximity of F444W and F560W (spanning 4–5.6 μm) probes the 4000 Å break at $z \sim 6$–8 or strong nebular lines at intermediate redshifts.
- The predicted abundance of H$\alpha$ and [OIII]+H$\beta$ emitters at $z > 6$ based on luminosity function extrapolations, and the critical need for deep 5 μm imaging to test these predictions and constrain the bright end of the line luminosity function.
- The emerging population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)—compact, red, high-redshift sources—and theoretical expectations for their surface density at $z > 10$ in small-area ultra-deep surveys versus wide-area shallow surveys.

### [UV slopes of Starforming Galaxies in Strong Lensing fields at the Epoch of Reionization with JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17499)

**Authors:** Giordano Felicioni, Maru\v{s}a Brada\v{c}, Yoshihisa Asada, Nicholas S. Martis, Ghassan T. E. Sarrouh, Guillaume Desprez, Gregor Rihtar\v{s}i\v{c}, Naadiyah Jagga, et al. (23 total)
**Relevance Score:** 7.5/10

Recent studies suggest that the UV spectral slopes (β) of galaxies—which trace dust content, star formation, and ionizing photon escape—stop evolving at $z>7$, contrary to trends at lower redshifts. This work exploits strong gravitational lensing in seven massive galaxy clusters to measure β for 378 faint galaxies ($z=7.5$–12.5, $M_{\rm UV}\sim-16$ to $-18$) during the Epoch of Reionization using JWST imaging and spectroscopy. The analysis confirms a flat $\beta$–$z$ relation at $z>7.5$ (average $\beta=-2.3\pm0.4$) and reveals only a weak correlation between UV slope and luminosity, indicating that early galaxies lacked sufficient time to build up dust regardless of mass. For 14 galaxies with emission lines, the inferred ionizing escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc}\sim0.26$) suggests these faint sources could significantly contribute to cosmic reionization, though this value may be overestimated by low-redshift calibrations.

### [Causal Reversal in the $M_\unicode{x25CF}\unicode{x2013}\sigma_0$ Relation: Implications for High-Redshift Supermassive Black Hole Mass Estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16775)

**Authors:** Benjamin L. Davis, Saakshi More, Zehao Jin, Mario Pasquato, Andrea Valerio Macci\`o, Feng Yuan
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

The study probes the causal nature of the $M_\bullet$–$\sigma$ relation, seeking to explain why supermassive black holes (SMBHs) appear to drive the evolution of spiral galaxies while remaining passive passengers in ellipticals. By analyzing the NIHAO cosmological zoom-in simulations, the authors track how causal directions evolve with cosmic time, discovering that the relationship inverts around the epoch of peak star formation: SMBHs initially grow in lockstep with their hosts before transitioning to regulate galaxy evolution. This temporal causal reversal indicates that standard scaling relations severely overestimate high-redshift SMBH masses by roughly two orders of magnitude, resolving the puzzle of apparently "overmassive" early black holes by showing they actually follow local mass ratios when causally-informed calibrations are used.

### [The CGM with local universe FRBs: evidence of strong AGN feedback in a massive elliptical galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16781)

**Authors:** Samuel McCarty, Liam Connor, Ralf M. Konietzka
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

How does feedback expel gas from galaxy halos, and how can we measure the missing baryons? At low redshifts, Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) provide a clean probe of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) because the intergalactic contribution to their dispersion measure is negligible.

The authors select five local FRBs with minimal host interstellar medium contamination to weigh the gas content in halos of mass $\sim$10$^{11}$–10$^{13}$ $M_\odot$.

Their key finding is that one massive elliptical host has been almost completely evacuated of gas, retaining only $\sim$10% of the cosmological baryon average ($M_\mathrm{gas} \approx 0.02\,M_\mathrm{h}$), consistent with powerful AGN feedback. In contrast, lower-mass hosts retain more baryons, suggesting that feedback operates less efficiently in $L_*$ galaxies than in group-scale halos.

This demonstrates that FRBs can measure halo gas fractions across a wider mass range than other methods; upcoming all-sky surveys will enable precision studies of how feedback regulates cosmic gas.

### [The Sign-Switching of the Cosmological Constant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16795)

**Authors:** Mariam Bouhmadi-L\'opez, Be\~nat Ibarra-Uriondo
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

What if dark energy was negative in the early Universe? This work investigates models where the cosmological constant evolves from negative values at high redshift to positive values today, challenging the standard assumption of a constant dark energy term. The authors employ cosmographic diagnostics and linear perturbation theory—evolving adiabatic fluctuations from the radiation era onward—to analyze both smooth and abrupt "ladder-step" transition scenarios. They find these sign-switching models remain compatible with current observations while leaving unique fingerprints on cosmic structure formation, specifically altering the evolution of matter density contrasts and the $f\sigma_8$ observable relative to $\Lambda$CDM. This provides a phenomenologically viable framework for dynamical dark energy that offers testable alternatives to the standard cosmological model.

### [Testing the cosmic distance-duality relation with localized fast radio bursts: a cosmological model-independent study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16869)

**Authors:** J\'eferson A. S. Fortunato, Surajit Kalita, Amanda Weltman
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

This study tests the Etherington cosmic distance-duality relation (CDDR)—a foundational assumption that luminosity distance $D_L$ equals $(1+z)^2$ times the angular diameter distance $D_A$—by comparing Type Ia supernova distances from the Pantheon+ compilation with model-independent angular diameter distances inferred from localized fast radio bursts (FRBs).

- **Methodology:** The authors use artificial neural networks to non-parametrically reconstruct the FRB dispersion measure-redshift relation, deriving $H(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ without assuming a specific cosmic expansion history; they test for CDDR violations via the parameter $\eta(z) \equiv D_L/[(1+z)^2 D_A]$ using two complementary statistical approaches.

- **Key Results:** No statistically significant evidence for deviations from the CDDR is found at current precision; the analysis also yields a data-driven constraint on the average host galaxy contribution to the dispersion measure of $128.8\pm34.1\,\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$.

- **Significance:** This provides a novel, cosmological model-independent validation of a core tenet of standard metric gravity theories, demonstrating that FRBs can serve as robust, independent probes for testing fundamental cosmological relations.

### [Deeper detection limits in astronomical imaging using self-supervised spatiotemporal denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17205)

**Authors:** Yuduo Guo, Hao Zhang, Mingyu Li, Fujiang Yu, Yunjing Wu, Yuhan Hao, Song Huang, Yongming Liang, et al. (13 total)
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

- **Problem**: Deep astronomical imaging is fundamentally limited by correlated noise between neighboring pixels and sequential exposures that conventional processing cannot fully suppress.
- **Method**: A self-supervised transformer algorithm (ASTERIS) that learns to identify and remove noise by exploiting spatiotemporal correlations across multiple exposures, without requiring noise-free training data.
- **Key Results**: Improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity in benchmarks; validates on JWST and Subaru data to reveal faint low-surface-brightness structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs previously lost in noise.
- **Impact**: Applied to deep JWST fields, the method identifies three times as many redshift > 9 galaxy candidates that are 1.0 magnitude fainter than previous techniques, significantly enhancing the scientific yield of existing observations.

### [MUSEQuBES: Probing Anisotropies in Gas and Metal Distributions in the Circumgalactic Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17593)

**Authors:** Sayak Dutta, Sowgat Muzahid, Joop Schaye, Sean Johnson, Edmund Christian Herenz, Ismael Pessa, Ramona Augustin, Nicolas F. Bouch\'e, et al. (12 total)
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

This study investigates whether gas and metals in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are distributed isotropically around galaxies or exhibit anisotropies relative to galactic disks. Using H I and O VI absorption measurements from 113 isolated galaxies at redshifts $z \approx 0.12$–0.75, the authors find that low-mass galaxies ($\log(M_*/M_\odot) \approx 7$–9) display a bimodal CGM distribution with enhanced covering fractions along both the disk plane and polar directions, whereas massive galaxies ($\log(M_*/M_\odot) \approx 9$–11.3) show azimuthally uniform, isotropic gas distributions. Additionally, O VI absorbers exhibit kinematically narrower velocity widths along the disk plane compared to polar directions, indicating that metal kinematics retain memory of their origin site even when spatially well-mixed in massive halos. These results demonstrate that CGM structure is strongly mass-dependent, suggesting that different physical processes—such as feedback and accretion—govern gas geometry across the galaxy mass spectrum.

### [A Chemodynamical Census of the Milky Way's Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites. I. A First Population-Level Look at the Internal Kinematics and Metallicities of 19 Extremely-Low-Mass Halo Stellar Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17652)

**Authors:** William Cerny, Ting S. Li, Andrew B. Pace, Joshua D. Simon, Marla Geha, Alexander P. Ji, Alex Drlica-Wagner, Jordan Bruce, et al. (16 total)
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

The nature of ultra-faint compact satellites (UFCSs)—extremely low-mass, compact stellar systems in the Milky Way halo—has remained uncertain due to a lack of spectroscopic constraints on whether they are star clusters or tiny galaxies. Using Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 systems (two-thirds of the known population), the authors conducted the first population-level study of their internal kinematics and metallicities. They find that while some UFCSs are clearly clusters, up to half (9 of 19) exhibit cold kinematics and diverse metallicities ([Fe/H] spanning −3.3 to −0.8) consistent with being dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies. This suggests that many UFCSs may be the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered, blurring the traditional boundary between star clusters and dwarf galaxies at the lowest mass scales.

### [A Sample of Nearby Isolated Dwarf Galaxies: A First Look at the Mass Function of Field Dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16766)

**Authors:** Scott Carlsten, Jiaxuan Li, Jenny Greene, Alex Drlica-Wagner, Shany Danieli
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

Despite their importance for cosmology, isolated field dwarf galaxies remain poorly cataloged compared to their clustered counterparts. The ELVES-Field survey addresses this gap by mapping 3,000 square degrees of the Local Volume (D < 10 Mpc) using a semi-automated algorithm optimized for low surface brightness objects. The team confirmed 95 nearby dwarfs—44 of which meet strict criteria for isolation—and inferred the first field dwarf mass function, finding agreement with IllustrisTNG simulations at the high-mass end. This sample provides a crucial baseline for investigating how environment influences dwarf galaxy evolution and for testing small-scale structure formation models.

### [ELVES-Field: Isolated Dwarf Galaxy Quenched Fractions Rise Below $M_* \approx 10^7$ $M_\odot$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16778)

**Authors:** Scott Carlsten, Jiaxuan Li, Jenny Greene, Alex Drlica-Wagner, Shany Danieli
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

- **Question:** What quenches star formation in the lowest-mass dwarf galaxies, and can this occur even in isolated environments far from massive hosts?
- **Approach:** The study uses the ELVES-Field survey to identify 95 confirmed isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume, complete down to $10^6$ solar masses and selected to lie beyond twice the virial radius of any massive group.
- **Key Finding:** While essentially all isolated field dwarfs above $10^7$ solar masses are star-forming, approximately 30% of those below this mass threshold are quenched; isolated dwarfs are also roughly 20% smaller than satellite galaxies of the same mass.
- **Implications:** Star formation in the lowest-mass galaxies can cease due to internal processes or cosmic reionization alone, challenging the assumption that environmental effects from massive hosts are required to quench dwarfs.

### [Analytical Estimates of Gravitational Wave Background Anisotropies from Shot Noise and Large-Scale Structure in Pulsar Timing Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16808)

**Authors:** Meng-Xiang Lin, Adam Lidz, Chung-Pei Ma
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

- **Context:** Next-generation pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements aim to detect directional variations (anisotropies) in the nanohertz gravitational-wave background (GWB) produced by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs).

- **Methods:** The authors analytically calculate GWB anisotropies using empirical SMBHB merger-rate models, quantifying two distinct contributions: shot noise from the discrete, sparse distribution of sources and correlations tracing the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe.

- **Key Results:** The shot-noise anisotropy is typically comparable to or larger than current NANOGrav upper limits—making it detectable in the near future—and its frequency dependence provides a direct test of SMBHB residence times. In contrast, LSS-induced anisotropies are two to three orders of magnitude smaller and likely undetectable.

- **Implications:** Upcoming PTA data, or reanalyses using frequency-dependent templates, can either detect the shot-noise signal or place stringent constraints on SMBHB merger models, provided analyses account for the full probability distribution of possible amplitudes rather than simple ensemble averages.
