### [Consistency of standard cosmologies using Bayesian model comparison and tension quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06115)

**Authors:** Lukas Tobias Hergt, Sophie Henrot-Versillé, Matthieu Tristram, Douglas Scott
**Relevance Score:** 8.3/10

### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The study concludes that claims of needing to update the standard cosmological model from ΛCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature, as updated Planck processing and recent BAO measurements weaken tensions and shift inferred discrepancies.

### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main result:** Updated Planck processing and recent BAO measurements significantly reduce tensions and shift inferred discrepancies, weakening the preference for a closed geometry and evolving dark energy.
- **Methodology highlight:** The study uses a Bayesian approach to compare ΛCDM and minimal extensions (neutrino mass, spatial curvature, constant or evolving dark energy) using CMB, BAO, and SN data.
- **Unexpected or surprising result:** The preference for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations is highly sensitive to the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods, with plausible alternatives shifting inferred tensions by more than $1\,σ$ and potentially reversing the preferred model.
- **Connection to broader field:** This work highlights the importance of updated data processing and careful likelihood pairing in cosmological model comparisons, suggesting that current tensions may be resolved without invoking more complex models.

### [On the Difficulties with Late-Time Solutions for the Hubble Tension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06293)

**Authors:** Prakhar Bansal, Dragan Huterer
**Relevance Score:** 7.9/10

Prakhar Bansal and Dragan Huterer investigate the challenges in resolving the Hubble tension using cosmological models that alter the late-time expansion history of the universe. They employ phenomenological models to demonstrate that fitting the Hubble constant measurements from the SH0ES collaboration, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations data, and Type Ia supernova distances simultaneously is only possible under specific conditions: either a sharp step in the absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae at very low redshift ($z \sim 0.01$) or a violation of the distance duality relation. The study also identifies less effective late-time solutions with a transition at $z \simeq 0.15$. These findings highlight the limitations of late-time expansion modifications in addressing the Hubble tension and underscore the need for alternative approaches or more refined models.

### [Connecting the Dots: UV-Bright Companions of Little Red Dots as Lyman-Werner Sources Enabling Direct Collapse Black Hole Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02702)

**Authors:** Josephine F. W. Baggen, Matthew T. Scoggins, Pieter van Dokkum, Zoltán Haiman, Alberto Torralba, Jorryt Matthee
**Relevance Score:** 7.6/10

The paper "Connecting the Dots: UV-Bright Companions of Little Red Dots as Lyman-Werner Sources Enabling Direct Collapse Black Hole Formation" investigates whether UV-bright companions of Little Red Dots (LRDs) could be responsible for enabling direct collapse black hole formation. The authors compile a sample of 83 LRDs using JWST imaging and find that approximately 43% of these LRDs host one or more UV-bright companions at projected separations of 0.5 to 5 kpc, with a median separation of 1.0 kpc. For the most luminous LRDs, this fraction rises to over 85%. The study explores the possibility that UV radiation from these companions suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, facilitating nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects like massive black holes. This finding suggests that the observed configurations of red/blue companions in LRD systems are consistent with theoretical models of direct-collapse black hole formation, providing a potential explanation for the compactness and spectral properties of LRDs observed in the early universe.

### [Modelling the photometric and morphological evolution of disc galaxies in the cluster environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06119)

**Authors:** A. Marasco, B. M. Poggianti, B. Vulcani, A. Moretti, M. Gullieuszik, J. Fritz
**Relevance Score:** 7.5/10

The paper "Modelling the photometric and morphological evolution of disc galaxies in the cluster environment" by A. Marasco et al. investigates the rapid transformation of disc galaxies in galaxy clusters from blue spirals to red S0s over the past 7 billion years. The authors develop a simplified cluster evolutionary model within the ΛCDM framework, incorporating ram-pressure stripping (RPS) to quench star formation and an unspecified mechanism for morphological transformation. Using data from the OmegaWINGS and EDisCS surveys at redshifts around 0.055 and 0.7, they find that the typical timescale for star formation quenching ($t_{\rm s}$) is between 0.1 and 1 Gyr, with a strong anti-correlation to the galaxy-to-cluster mass ratio, driven by orbit anisotropy. The morphological transformation timescale ($t_{\rm m}$) is a few Gyr and weakly dependent on mass ratio. This study confirms spectrophotometric ageing as a key driver of the spiral-to-S0 transition, highlighting the importance of environmental effects in galaxy evolution.

### [Dynamic Zoom Simulations of structure formation beyond standard cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06133)

**Authors:** Riccardo Zangarelli, Marco Baldi, Federico Marinacci, Enrico Garaldi
**Relevance Score:** 7.4/10

The paper "Dynamic Zoom Simulations of structure formation beyond standard cosmology" by Riccardo Zangarelli, Marco Baldi, Federico Marinacci, and Enrico Garaldi addresses the challenge of conducting large-scale, high-resolution cosmological simulations for interpreting current and future observational data. The authors introduce the Dynamic Zoom Simulations (DZS) method, which dynamically reduces simulation resolution in regions not causally connected to the observer, thereby saving computational resources. They implemented DZS in two advanced simulation codes, Arepo and Gadget4, supporting non-standard cosmologies like modified $f(R)$ gravity and dark sector interactions. The DZS method achieves accuracy within $\simeq$ 0.1% for lightcone halo mass functions, mass maps, and matter and weak lensing convergence power spectra, while reducing runtime by up to $\sim$ 50% and potentially more for larger volumes. This advancement enables cost-effective, large-scale simulations with state-of-the-art resolution, crucial for interpreting forthcoming cosmological data.

### [Galaxies caught in transition: the role of group environment in shaping the mass-size relation in the local Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06719)

**Authors:** Gissel P. Montaguth, Claudia Mendes de Oliveira, Ciria Lima-Dias, Antonela Monachesi, Sergio Torres-Flores, Eduardo Telles, Fábio R. Herpich, Yolanda Jiménez-Teja, et al. (11 total)
**Relevance Score:** 7.4/10

The paper investigates how the local group environment influences the mass-size relation of galaxies, focusing on compact groups, low-mass groups, and high-mass groups compared to field galaxies. Using data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey, the authors classify galaxies into early types (ETGs), late types (LTGs), transition galaxies (TGs), and others (OGs). They find that ETGs and OGs show no significant environmental dependence, while LTGs exhibit only a modest tendency to be smaller in compact groups. However, TGs display a clear environmental signal, with a steeper mass-size slope and smaller sizes in groups, suggesting enhanced structural evolution likely due to increased bulge prominence and outer disc fading. This highlights TGs as an environmentally sensitive population, providing insights into the structural transformation of galaxies in group environments.

### [The imprint of AGN-driven outflows on the CGM: the case of Lyα nebulae around high-z quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06128)

**Authors:** Silvia C. Rueda-Vargas, Vincenzo Mainieri, Giulia Tozzi, Darshan Kakkad, Fabrizio Arrigoni-Battaia, Tiago Costa, Emanuele Paolo Farina, Chris M. Harrison
**Relevance Score:** 6.7/10

The paper investigates whether outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) power the Lyα nebulae observed around high-redshift quasars, as predicted by cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The authors analyze integral-field unit data from VLT/ERIS and GEMINI/GNIRS to trace ionized gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of six quasars at z~2-3, using the [O III] emission line. They detect powerful outflows in all quasars, with velocities >1500 km/s and kinetic energies ≥2×10⁴³ erg/s. The study finds a positive correlation between outflow power and Lyα nebula size (ρ=0.89, p=0.03) and luminosity (ρ=0.6, p=0.28), and spatial alignment between the ionization cone and the brightest regions of the Lyα nebula. These results support the theory that AGN-driven outflows create a low-optical-depth path for Lyα photons to escape to the circumgalactic medium, forming extended nebulae.

**Relevance Score:** 6.3/10

The paper investigates the X-ray properties of extremely luminous, radio-quiet quasars with strong emission-line outflows to understand the connection between X-ray emission and powerful winds. The authors analyzed the Chandra X-ray spectral properties of 10 such quasars, selected based on their UV luminosities and CIV emission line blueshifts, and compared them to typical optically blue quasars. They found that most of these quasars have photon indices Γ > 1.7, and only two out of 10 with outflow velocities exceeding 1400 km/s are X-ray 'weak', suggesting a complex relationship between X-ray emission and wind presence. This study underscores the need for larger samples to better understand the interplay between winds and X-ray emission in quasars.

Pushkarev et al. investigate the scattering properties of the partly ionized interstellar medium in the Galactic plane region where the Galactic bar meets the spiral arms, an area rich in star formation. Using the VLBA, they conducted wide-field VLBI observations at L, S, and C-bands, finding that scattering is strong and non-uniform across the region, peaking at the Galactic mid-plane. The detection rate of scattering increased with frequency, and one source exhibited anisotropic scattering aligned with the line of constant Galactic latitude. This study provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the interstellar medium in a critical region of the Galaxy, contributing to our understanding of star formation environments.

### [Universality of Primordial Anisotropies in Gravitational Wave Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06562)

**Authors:** Boyuan Jiang, Ryo Saito, Ying-li Zhang
**Relevance Score:** 6.3/10

The paper "Universality of Primordial Anisotropies in Gravitational Wave Background" by Boyuan Jiang, Ryo Saito, and Ying-li Zhang addresses the question of how anisotropies in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) can be universally described, despite their diverse origins such as Sachs-Wolfe effects, integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, or fossil effects from primordial non-Gaussianity. The authors propose a model-independent formalism based on the Cosmological Form Factor (CFF), which encapsulates how long-wavelength modes modulate SGWB statistics. They demonstrate that statistical isotropy and locality principles determine the angular dependence of the CFF, leading to a universal multipole scaling of SGWB anisotropies. This CFF formalism not only provides a common language for classifying SGWB anisotropies but also offers a robust framework for interpreting future observations, potentially unifying disparate phenomena under a single theoretical umbrella.

### [On the radial velocity wave in the Galactic disk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06182)

**Authors:** Chris Hamilton, Andrew Mummery, Joss Bland-Hawthorn
**Relevance Score:** 5.5/10

The paper "On the radial velocity wave in the Galactic disk" by Chris Hamilton, Andrew Mummery, and Joss Bland-Hawthorn investigates the origin of the observed oscillations in the mean radial velocities of stars in the Galactic disk as a function of their angular momentum. Using linear perturbation theory, the authors derive an analytic formula for this "radial velocity wave" signal, which depends on the Galaxy's equilibrium properties and recent perturbations. They find that short-lived spiral arms can produce the observed wave, whereas distant tidal kicks or rigidly rotating bars cannot. The authors verify their formula with test particle simulations, showing it to be highly accurate for dynamically cold stellar populations. This work provides crucial insights into the mechanisms driving the radial velocity wave and highlights the importance of spiral arms in shaping the dynamics of the Galactic disk.

### [Primordial Black Hole Abundance from Reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06794)

**Authors:** Ziwen Yin, Hanyu Cheng, Luca Visinelli
**Relevance Score:** 5.4/10

The paper "Primordial Black Hole Abundance from Reionization" by Ziwen Yin, Hanyu Cheng, and Luca Visinelli addresses the question of how many primordial black holes (PBHs) could have existed in the early universe by examining their impact on cosmic reionization. The authors use a combination of numerical simulations and observational data to model the energy injection from PBHs into the intergalactic medium (IGM) due to Hawking radiation. They employ the \texttt{BlackHawk} and \texttt{DarkHistory} tools to account for the time-dependent mass loss of PBHs and the propagation of emitted particles through the primordial plasma. By integrating these effects into a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the free-electron fraction based on \textit{Planck} CMB data, they derive robust upper limits on the initial abundance of PBHs in the mass range $3.2\times 10^{13}\,\mathrm{g} \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 5\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$. These constraints are more conservative than previous bounds, highlighting the potential of reionization observables as a precise probe for PBHs and other late-time energy injection scenarios.
