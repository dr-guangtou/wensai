### [Back to Normal Again: Possible Destinies of JWST overmassive SMBHs and "Little Red Dots" in the View of Shin-Uchuu Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14496)

**Authors:** Haojie Hu, Hiroto Yanagisawa, Moka Nishigaki, Tomokazu Kiyota, Tomoaki Ishiyama, Ken Ohsuga
**Relevance Score:** 9.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

JWST-discovered "overmassive" SMBHs at $z > 4-7$ naturally return to local scaling relations by the present day through divergent early evolutionary paths—stunted accretion for initially overmassive systems and super-Eddington growth for their less massive counterparts—with all populations converging at $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^8~M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **Differential evolutionary tracks**: Overmassive SMBHs (with $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios 1-2 dex above local values at $z \sim 4-7$) experience stunted, sub-Eddington accretion that gradually reduces their mass ratios, while less massive BHs undergo super-Eddington accretion, increasing their ratios toward the local value
- **Convergence at $10^8~M_\odot$**: All evolutionary tracks converge at $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^8~M_\odot$ with $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$, effectively erasing memory of high-redshift overmassive conditions by low redshift
- **[Flag: Model-dependent result]**: The return to local relations is implicitly enforced by construction, as the models adopt empirical low-redshift constraints on star formation rates, BH accretion rates, and active/quiescent fractions; this represents a consistency check rather than a prediction from first principles
- **Little Red Dot connection**: The results suggest that compact "Little Red Dot" galaxies hosting overmassive BHs are transient high-redshift phases of normal massive galaxies that will evolve onto the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_\star$ relation by $z \sim 0$

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Simulation-based phenomenological modeling**

- **Primary simulation**: Shin-Uchuu N-body simulation (dark matter halo merger trees); one of the largest cosmological N-body simulations providing statistics for rare high-redshift halos
- **Modeling approach**: Semi-empirical (phenomenological) prescriptions for BH growth and galaxy star formation applied to dark matter halo histories, rather than full hydrodynamical simulation
- **Initial conditions**: JWST-discovered SMBH populations at $z = 4-7$, specifically targeting overmassive systems with $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.1-1.0$ (including Little Red Dots)
- **Tracked properties**: BH mass, stellar mass, BH-to-galaxy mass ratio, accretion modes (stunted/sub-Eddington vs. super-Eddington), and quiescent/active fractions
- **Temporal range**: Forward evolution from discovery epoch ($z \sim 4-7$) to $z \sim 0$ (present day)
- **Key assumption**: Feedback mechanisms regulating coevolution are encoded in local empirical relations, which drives the convergence result

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS

- **Shin-Uchuu Simulation**: Dark matter N-body simulation (likely descendant of the Uchuu simulation; http://www.skiesanduniverses.org/Simulations/Uchuu/)
- **Phenomenological models**: Custom semi-empirical codes for BH-galaxy coevolution (specific repository not specified in available text)

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- JWST has revealed hundreds of SMBHs at $z \gtrsim 4-7$, with a non-negligible fraction exhibiting "overmassive" BH-to-galaxy mass ratios (10-100$\times$ above local scaling relations), challenging standard coevolution paradigms and suggesting either heavy seed formation or extreme early growth efficiency
- The origin of overmassive BHs remains debated between formation from massive seeds (e.g., direct collapse black holes in primordial halos) versus rapid accretion onto stellar-mass seeds, with implications for early cosmic star formation and BH feedback
- "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) represent a newly identified population of extremely compact, red galaxies at high redshift that frequently host these overmassive SMBHs, serving as critical laboratories for studying early BH-galaxy assembly and the onset of coevolution

### [Multiwavelength Characterization of a Dynamically Relaxed Cool Core Galaxy Cluster at $z=1.5$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14882)

**Authors:** Anthony M. Flores, Adam B. Mantz, Steven W. Allen, R. Glenn Morris, Abigail Y. Pan, Taweewat Somboonpanyakul, Haley R. Stueber, Michael McDonald
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

ACT-CL J0123.5$-$0428 at $z=1.50$ is the most distant dynamically relaxed cool-core galaxy cluster currently known, featuring a rapidly cooling intracluster medium (central cooling time $\sim$280 Myr) and a quiescent brightest cluster galaxy that implies AGN feedback has suppressed star formation since $z\sim2.5$.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **Most distant relaxed cool core**: The cluster at $z=1.50\pm0.03$ is identified as the highest-redshift dynamically relaxed cool-core system discovered to date, with Chandra revealing a strong temperature drop to $kT = 1.8\pm0.6$ keV within the central $\sim$40 kpc, while XMM-Newton measures a mean temperature of $7.3\pm1.1$ keV and metallicity of $Z/Z_\odot = 0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.25}$ out to $r_{500}$.

- **Extreme cooling without star formation**: Despite a short central cooling time of $t_\mathrm{cool}=280^{+150}_{-120}$ Myr and sharply peaked ICM density/surface brightness, the coincident BCG shows no optical/IR signatures of recent or ongoing star formation, presenting a challenge to simple cooling flow models that predict condensation and star formation in such environments.

- **Long-term AGN feedback**: The quiescent BCG state suggests that AGN feedback has been acting persistently to offset cooling flows for approximately 3–4 Gyr (since $z\sim2.5$), providing evidence that self-regulated feedback cycles were established early in massive cluster histories.

- **Cosmological significance**: As one of the most massive clusters detected by ACT at $z>1$, this system serves as a premier laboratory for studying early cluster formation, ICM enrichment, and testing structure formation models in the epoch when massive halos were rapidly assembling.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational study** combining X-ray imaging/spectroscopy with optical/IR photometry.

**Methodologies:**
- **Chandra ACIS**: Morphological characterization of relaxation state; geometric deprojection analysis; temperature profile constrained in 2 spatial bins out to $r_{2500}$; central cooling time calculation from density and temperature profiles.
- **XMM-Newton**: Novel forward-modeling analysis extending imaging and spectroscopic constraints to $r_{500}$; simultaneous fitting for redshift, global temperature, and metallicity.
- **Optical/IR**: Photometric analysis of the BCG (noted as limited coverage) to constrain stellar populations and star formation history.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

*(Based on abstract context and standard cluster formation physics; specific introduction text not provided)*

- **High-z cool core rarity and evolution**: The scarcity of confirmed relaxed, cool-core clusters at $z>1.4$ creates tension with hierarchical formation models regarding the timescales required for halo virialization, ICM thermalization, and the establishment of strong central entropy gradients in massive systems.

- **The cooling feedback paradox at early times**: The existence of massive, rapidly cooling ICM reservoirs at $z\sim1.5$ without accompanying star formation episodes tests the universality and efficiency of AGN feedback mechanisms, specifically whether supermassive black holes could grow sufficiently early to establish self-regulated heating that prevents catastrophic cooling over >3 Gyr timescales.

- **Cosmological utility of relaxed high-z clusters**: Massive, dynamically relaxed clusters at high redshift serve as critical probes for constraining the distance scale and measuring gas mass fraction evolution, provided their complex ICM physics (cooling, feedback, metallicity) can be disentangled from cosmological signals.

### [LIGHTS. The Thin Encircling Stellar Stream of NGC 3938](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14192)

**Authors:** Dennis Zaritsky, Jacob Nibauer, Giulia Golini, Ignacio Ruiz Cejudo, Ignacio Trujillo, Sarah Pearson, Nushkia Chamba, Chen-Yu Chuang, et al. (20 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The authors report the discovery of an ultra-faint (μ_r ≈ 28.1 mag arcsec⁻²), thin stellar stream wrapping more than halfway around the isolated, face-on spiral galaxy NGC 3938, demonstrating that even apparently simple host galaxies harbor low-mass accretion debris detectable only with deep imaging and providing a benchmark for future Rubin/LSST stream discoveries.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Extreme faintness and physical parameters**: The stream has a mean surface brightness of ⟨μ_g⟩ ≈ 28.7 and ⟨μ_r⟩ ≈ 28.1 mag arcsec⁻², wraps >180° around the host, and originated from a progenitor with stellar mass ~3.7 × 10⁷ M⊙.
- **Standard models explain gross morphology**: An apparent offset between the host galaxy's optical center and the stream's orbital center—initially suggesting a complex potential—can be reproduced using simple models with a thin disk centered in a canonical spherical dark matter halo.
- **Substructure requires complex physics**: The stream exhibits localized variations in curvature and stellar density that simple models cannot reproduce, indicating the need to account for progenitor structure, dark matter subhalos, or non-static potentials.
- **Forecast for Rubin/LSST**: **(Claim requiring verification)** The authors predict that 10-year stacks of Rubin/LSST data will reveal comparable streams around a majority of nearby giant galaxies, implying such structures are common but currently below typical surface brightness detection limits.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Paper Type:** Observational (deep imaging and dynamical modeling)

**Methodology:**
- **Targets:** NGC 3938, a nearby (inferred z ~ 0.002–0.003), nearly face-on, late-type spiral galaxy selected from the LIGHTS survey.
- **Observables:** Deep optical surface brightness photometry in *g* and *r* bands; stream geometry (curvature, width, angular extent >180°); progenitor stellar mass inferred from integrated stream luminosity.
- **Modeling:** Dynamical simulations of satellite disruption in a static gravitational potential consisting of a thin exponential disk embedded within a spherical dark matter halo (likely NFW profile), testing whether apparent kinematic offsets require triaxial or perturbed potentials.

**Quick Reference Table:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | N = 1 galaxy (NGC 3938); 1 confirmed stream |
| Redshift | z ≈ 0.002–0.003 (nearby; inferred from "nearby" designation) |
| Key instruments | LBT (Large Binocular Telescope) |
| Data products | Deep co-added *g*- and *r*-band images; surface brightness profiles; orbital model parameters |
| Citation to note | LIGHTS survey (survey design and data release) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **LIGHTS Survey:** LBT Imaging of Galactic Halos and Tidal Structures (primary observational program)
- **LBT Archive:** Processed imaging data from the Large Binocular Telescope
- **Modeling Software:** Specific codes not detailed in abstract; likely custom N-body or test-particle integration codes for stream modeling

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Stellar streams in external galaxies serve as precise tracers of the gravitational potential and triaxiality of dark matter halos, offering constraints independent of kinematic tracers like gas or globular clusters.
- The "missing satellites" problem and the predicted hierarchy of structure formation suggest that low-mass accretion events should be common, but their detection is limited by surface brightness thresholds of current surveys (typically μ > 26–27 mag arcsec⁻²).
- Next-generation facilities like Rubin/LSST will reach surface brightness limits of μ ~ 28–29 mag arcsec⁻², transitioning the study of faint tidal streams from rare discoveries to statistical ensembles capable of constraining galaxy assembly histories.

### [Direct pathway to the Early Supermassive Black Holes: A Red Super-Eddington Quasar in a Massive Starburst Host at $z=7.2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12325)

**Authors:** Qinyue Fei, Seiji Fujimoto, Gabriel Brammer, Ruancun Li, Luis C. Ho, Volker Bromm, Javier Álvarez-Márquez, Yoshihisa Asada, et al. (27 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

GNz7q at $z=7.2$ represents a rare evolutionary phase featuring a rapidly growing super-Eddington black hole ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}\approx2.7$, $M_{\rm BH}\approx10^{7.6}\,M_\odot$) embedded in a massive dusty starburst galaxy ($M_*\approx10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$, SFR$\approx330\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$) that lies on the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation, providing a plausible direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems observed within the first billion years and contrasting sharply with star-formation-deficient Little Red Dots.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **Main Result:** The system hosts a super-Eddington accreting black hole ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}=2.7\pm0.4$, $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)=7.55\pm0.34$) within a massive, dusty starburst host ($\log(M_*/M_\odot)=10.5\pm0.4$, SFR$=330\pm97\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$) at $z=7.1899$, with a BH-to-host mass ratio of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\simeq0.001$ consistent with the local relation.
- **Methodology:** Deep JWST/NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM$=2221\pm20$kms$^{-1}$) enabling accretion-rate-corrected virial BH mass estimation, combined with panchromatic NIRCam/MIRI photometry and NOEMA mm observations for host galaxy decomposition and stellar population synthesis.
- **Critical Distinction:** Unlike recently discovered "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) at similar redshifts that exhibit high BH-to-host mass ratios with weak or undetected star formation, GNz7q shows intense concurrent star formation, suggesting it can evolve into the massive galaxy hosts ($M_*\approx10^{11}\,M_\odot$) of SDSS quasars by $z\sim6$ with $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)\approx9$.
- **Broader Implication:** The system represents a pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-evolution where both components grow rapidly in tandem, offering a viable "direct pathway" to early supermassive black holes without requiring the host to catch up from a BH-dominated state.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational Study:** Single-object deep characterization of a known X-ray weak quasar candidate.

**Methodologies:**
- **Spectroscopy:** Deep NIRSpec/G395M observations to detect broad H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ lines for dynamical BH mass estimation using accretion-rate-corrected virial relations
- **Imaging:** Multi-filter NIRCam and MIRI photometry for stellar continuum detection after AGN point-source subtraction
- **Millimeter:** Archival NOEMA observations for dust and gas mass constraints
- **Analysis:** Joint morphological-spectral decomposition to separate unresolved AGN emission from extended host galaxy stellar emission; SED fitting to derive stellar masses and star formation rates

| Property | Value |

| Sample size | $N=1$ (GNz7q in GOODS-North) |
| Redshift | $z=7.1899$ |

| Data products | Spectroscopic redshift, BH mass ($10^{7.55}\,M_\odot$), host stellar mass ($10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$), SEDs, morphological parameters |
| Citation to note | This work (Fei et al.); discovery paper likely Matsuoka et al. (2019) or similar GNz7q reference |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS

- **JWST Archive:** NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy (Program ID to be specified in paper), NIRCam and MIRI imaging in GOODS-North field
- **NOEMA Archive:** Archival millimeter continuum observations
- **HST Legacy Data:** Likely utilized for morphological constraints (implied by "point source subtraction" context)
- **Software:** Standard JWST pipeline reductions; SED fitting tools (likely CIGALE, Prospector, or similar; specific software not detailed in abstract)

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- **Early SMBH Formation Crisis:** The existence of billion-solar-mass black holes at $z>6$ (within $\sim1$ Gyr of the Big Bang) challenges standard accretion theory, requiring either super-Eddington growth, massive seeds from direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), or rapid hierarchical merging that maintains the observed $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation.
- **Little Red Dots Tension:** Recent JWST discoveries of LRDs at $z\sim4-7$ show compact, red AGN with high BH-to-host mass ratios ($M_{\rm BH}/M_*\sim0.1-1$) and minimal star formation, raising doubts about whether they can evolve into the massive quiescent hosts of $z\sim6$ SDSS quasars without violating the local scaling relations.
- **Co-evolution Benchmarks:** The $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation serves as a fundamental observational constraint on BH-galaxy growth models, with significant debate regarding whether high-redshift systems should lie on, above, or below the local relation depending on the relative duty cycles of BH accretion and star formation.

### [Reduction of bar fraction in paired galaxies in the SDSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14873)

**Authors:** Linlin Li, Shuai Feng, Shiyin Shen, Qi'an Deng, Ying Zu, Wenyuan Cui
**Relevance Score:** 8.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Tidal interactions in close galaxy pairs (projected separations $<25$ kpc) selectively suppress weak stellar bars—particularly in massive hosts undergoing major mergers—while leaving strong bar fractions unchanged, indicating that perturbations regulate bar evolution through destruction rather than universal triggering.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main result:** Bar fraction is significantly reduced in close pairs compared to isolated galaxies, but only within projected separations $<25$ kpc and exclusively in systems exhibiting clear merger or disturbance signatures; this establishes tidal interactions as a suppressive mechanism rather than a trigger for bar formation.
- **Methodology:** Analysis of SDSS galaxy pairs with careful separation by interaction state (disturbed vs. undisturbed), bar strength classification (weak vs. strong), and merger mass ratio (major vs. minor), compared against a control sample of isolated galaxies.
- **Unexpected selectivity:** The decline is driven entirely by weak bars, while strong bar fractions remain statistically unchanged even during ongoing interactions, suggesting that mature bars are robust structures resistant to tidal disruption, whereas nascent or weak bars are easily destroyed.
- **Mass and morphology dependence:** Bar suppression is strongest in major mergers involving massive hosts; minor mergers show significant suppression only in massive galaxies with small bulges, with no detected dependence on the relative orientation between pair members, ruling out alignment-specific resonant effects.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper type:** Observational analysis of SDSS imaging data.

**Methodologies:** The study utilizes the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to construct a sample of galaxy pairs with measured projected separations. Key observables include: (1) bar identification and classification by strength (weak vs. strong), likely via visual inspection or 2D bulge-disk-bar decomposition; (2) identification of tidal disturbance signatures to isolate systems undergoing active merger events; (3) stellar mass estimates to distinguish major mergers (mass ratio $<4:1$) from minor mergers; (4) bulge-to-total or structural parameters to classify bulge prominence. The analysis compares bar fractions as a function of projected separation ($<25$ kpc vs. wider pairs/isolated) and controls for stellar mass and redshift.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | Not specified in abstract (SDSS pair sample, likely $N \sim 10^3-10^4$ pairs) |
| Redshift range | Not specified (typical for SDSS main galaxy sample: $z \sim 0.01-0.1$) |
| Key instruments | Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical imaging |
| Data products | Galaxy pair catalog, bar classifications (weak/strong), disturbance flags, stellar masses, bulge properties |
| Citation to note | Li et al. 2025 (arXiv:2602.14873) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)** - imaging and spectroscopic data (specific release not stated in abstract)
- Galaxy pair catalog (likely derived from SDSS spectroscopic sample with velocity cuts $\Delta v < 500$ km s$^{-1}$)
- Bar classification dataset (method unspecified: possibly Galaxy Zoo volunteer classifications or automated $GALFIT$/2D decomposition)
- Stellar mass estimates (likely from MPA-JHU catalog or similar SDSS value-added catalogs)

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Bar formation debate:** Bars are ubiquitous drivers of secular evolution in disk galaxies, but whether they form primarily through internal instabilities or are tidally triggered by interactions remains observationally ambiguous, with conflicting reports on bar fractions in high-density environments versus the field.
- **Interaction-stage sensitivity:** Earlier studies likely failed to distinguish between pre-merger, ongoing merger, and post-merger states; the suppression effect documented here appears confined to systems with visible disturbance signatures, explaining previous inconsistencies.
- **Bar strength dichotomy:** Theoretical models suggest that while interactions can induce bars in stable disks, violent relaxation during mergers should destroy them; this work probes whether weak (recently formed/unstable) and strong (mature) bars respond differently to tidal heating.

### [Large-scale and local environmental drivers of quenching: tracing H$α$ concentration in X-ray and optical galaxy groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14628)

**Authors:** Stefania Barsanti, Di Wang, Matthew Colless, Ang Liu, Esra Bulbul, Matt S. Owers, Scott M. Croom, Benedetta Vulcani, et al. (14 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Star-forming galaxies in X-ray-emitting groups and cosmic web nodes exhibit the most centrally concentrated star formation (lowest C-index), indicating that both local group environments and large-scale structure drive gas contraction toward galaxy centers through ram-pressure stripping and merger-driven processes.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main result:** X-ray+optical groups show the lowest median C-index (most concentrated star formation) compared to optical-only groups and field galaxies, with star formation becoming progressively more concentrated in higher X-ray luminosity groups at fixed dynamical mass; this trend is independent of group mass or stellar mass.
- **Methodology:** Combines GAMA spectroscopic survey data for group identification and cosmic web reconstruction (nodes/filaments/voids), eROSITA X-ray data for hot gas detection, and SAMI integral-field spectroscopy to measure the concentration index C-index $\equiv\log{(r_{50,{\rm H}\alpha}/r_{50,\rm cont})}$ from spatially resolved H$\alpha$ emission maps.
- **Spin alignment dichotomy:** "Regular" star-forming galaxies show spin axes aligned parallel to cosmic filaments (consistent with smooth cold gas accretion), while centrally concentrated galaxies display spins perpendicular to filaments—suggesting merger-driven angular momentum disruption associated with bulge growth.
- **Large-scale dominance:** Distance to the nearest cosmic web node is the primary large-scale environmental driver of star formation concentration; other metrics (filament/void membership, local overdensity) show no significant residual correlation once node proximity is accounted for.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Study type:** Multi-wavelength observational analysis combining spectroscopic redshift surveys, X-ray imaging, and integral-field spectroscopy.

**Methodologies:**
- **Group selection:** Optical group identification via GAMA spectroscopic redshifts; X-ray group identification via eROSITA extended source detection to isolate virialized systems with hot intragroup medium.
- **Cosmic web reconstruction:** Density field and topological classification (nodes, filaments, voids) derived from GAMA galaxy positions and redshifts.
- **Star formation morphology:** Measurement of half-light radii in H$\alpha$ ($r_{50,{\rm H}\alpha}$) versus continuum ($r_{50,\rm cont}$) from SAMI IFU datacubes; C-index quantifies central concentration of star formation.
- **Spin alignment:** Galaxy major axis orientations relative to filament directions derived from cosmic web reconstruction.

- **Software references:** Not specified in abstract; likely uses standard IFU analysis pipelines (e.g., LZIFU, Pipe3D for SAMI data reduction).

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Environmental quenching mechanisms:** The paper likely contextualizes X-ray bright groups as the most extreme environments for ram-pressure stripping and galaxy harassment, contrasting with optically selected groups that may lack deep potential wells and hot gas reservoirs necessary for rapid quenching.
- **Cosmic web accretion:** The introduction presumably establishes that filaments serve as conduits for cold gas accretion (producing extended, disk-like star formation with spins parallel to filaments), while nodes represent regions of frequent mergers that scramble angular momentum and drive gas toward galactic centers.
- **C-index as evolutionary tracer:** The concentration of star formation toward galactic centers is positioned as an observable signature of "morphological quenching" or bulge growth that precedes full star formation cessation, bridging the gap between active star-forming disks and quiescent spheroidals.

### [VENUS: Strong-lensing model of MACS J1931.8-2635 -- revealing the farthest multiply imaged supernova](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14074)

**Authors:** Joseph F. V. Allingham, Adi Zitrin, Vasily Kokorev, Hiroto Yanagisawa, Jose M. Diego, Lukas J. Furtak, Yoshihisa Asada, Dan Coe, et al. (44 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The authors present a parametric strong lens model of galaxy cluster MACS J1931.8-2635 constrained by 19 multiple-image systems that predicts five images of the z = 5.13 supernova Eos, with three unobserved images expected to have arrived 3.5–54 years earlier, confirming the transient nature of the farthest known multiply imaged supernova.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **SN Eos lensing predictions:** The model predicts five images of the z = 5.13 supernova: two observed radial images with similar magnifications (μ ≈ 25–30) and time delays < 5 days, plus three undetected images predicted to have arrived 3.7 ± 0.7, 3.5 ± 0.7, and 54.0 ± 10.8 years earlier with magnifications of 12.9 ± 2.6, 13.0 ± 2.9, and 2.2 ± 0.4, respectively.
- **Model constraints:** The lens model utilizes 19 robust multiple-image systems (10 newly identified in JWST/NIRCam VENUS imaging), including nine with spectroscopic redshifts, achieving a precision of r.m.s. = 0.44" between predicted and observed image positions.
- **Transient confirmation:** The absence of detections at the three predicted earlier image positions—despite visible lensed images of the host galaxy at those locations—provides definitive confirmation that SN Eos is a transient event rather than a persistent source.
- **Secondary discovery:** The model identifies a triply imaged grand-design spiral galaxy candidate at z ≈ 3.65_{-0.09}^{+0.04}, demonstrating the capacity to resolve complex background morphologies at high redshift.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Type:** Observational strong gravitational lens modeling

**Methodology:** Parametric mass modeling of the massive galaxy cluster MACS J1931.8-2635 (z_l = 0.35) using newly acquired JWST/NIRCam imaging from the VENUS program combined with archival HST imaging. The model employs 19 identified multiple-image systems (including 10 new discoveries) to constrain the cluster's dark matter distribution and gravitational potential. For SN Eos, the model calculates image positions, relative magnifications, and time delays to predict the properties of unobserved images and reconstruct the source plane geometry.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Strongly lensed supernovae provide independent cosmographic constraints on H₀ and dark energy through precise time-delay measurements, with high-redshift SNe (z > 5) offering unique access to early cosmic star formation and explosion physics inaccessible to conventional surveys.
- MACS J1931.8-2635 is a massive, X-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z = 0.35 previously identified as a powerful gravitational telescope, requiring updated lens models with JWST resolution to exploit its magnification potential for z > 5 sources.
- The detection and modeling of multiply imaged SNe requires sub-arcsecond precision in predicting image positions and time delays to distinguish between lensed transients and foreground contaminants, particularly for sources with decade-scale time delays where historical imaging constraints are limited.

### [STEP survey: III. STEPping stones between the clouds: the star formation history of the Magellanic Bridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12929)

**Authors:** F. Ficara, V. Ripepi, M. Cignoni, M. Gatto, M. Marconi, M. Tosi, M. Bellazzini, E. K. Grebel, et al. (11 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The Magellanic Bridge exhibits a dominant burst of star formation ~100 Myr ago—formed from low-metallicity gas stripped from the Small Magellanic Cloud during its most recent encounter with the Large Magellanic Cloud—superimposed on older stellar populations in the eastern (LMC-side) regions dating to ~10 and 2 Gyr ago, with a total stellar mass of approximately 5×10⁵ M⊙.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Recent interaction-triggered star formation**: A clear peak in star formation occurred ~100 Myr ago, becoming increasingly pronounced toward the SMC, with low metallicity consistent with SMC gas stripped during the most recent close LMC-SMC encounter.
- **Spatially varying stellar ages**: The eastern Bridge (LMC side) shows distinct older populations peaking at ~10 Gyr and ~2 Gyr ago, contrasting with the ubiquitous young stellar population.
- **Bridge mass and metallicity**: Total stellar mass is $(5.1 \pm 0.2) \times 10^5 \, M_\odot$ with a present-day stellar metallicity of $[\mathrm{Fe/H}] \sim -0.6$ dex, closely matching SMC values.
- **Methodological robustness**: SFH reconstruction using two independent stellar evolution libraries (PARSEC-COLIBRI and BaSTI) over the full metallicity range $-2.0 \leq [\mathrm{Fe/H}] \leq 0$ yields consistent results, validating the inferred age-metallicity relationships.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational study** employing deep optical photometry and synthetic CMD fitting.

**Methodologies:**
- **Data**: STEP (SMC in Time: Evolution of a Proximity) survey optical imaging covering $54 \, \mathrm{deg}^2$ across the SMC and Bridge, reaching below the oldest main sequence turn-off magnitude at Magellanic distances.
- **Analysis**: Synthetic color-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting applied to $14 \, \mathrm{deg}^2$ of the survey footprint.
- **Modeling**: Two independent synthetic stellar population libraries constructed using PARSEC-COLIBRI and BaSTI isochrones, sampling metallicities from $[\mathrm{Fe/H}] = -2.0$ to $0.0$ across cosmic time.
- **Inferred properties**: Star formation rates as a function of lookback time, age-metallicity relations, and spatially resolved stellar population gradients.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Magellanic Clouds as interaction laboratories**: The MC system provides the nearest example of ongoing dwarf galaxy interaction, offering spatially resolved constraints on tidal stripping and star formation triggering that are impossible to obtain in distant mergers.
- **The Bridge as a probe of cold gas stripping**: The Magellanic Bridge represents a rare case of tidally stripped neutral hydrogen that has subsequently formed stars, making it critical for understanding whether and how stripped gas retains its star-forming potential.
- **Chronology of encounters**: The timing of star formation in the Bridge (particularly the ~100 Myr peak) serves as an independent clock to constrain dynamical models of the LMC-SMC orbit and their most recent pericentric passage, currently debated to be 100–300 Myr ago.

### [Exploring Non-minimal coupling using ultra-diffuse galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14747)

**Authors:** Saboura Zamani, Vincenzo Salzano, Dario Bettoni
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

- **Scientific question:** Can a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and spacetime curvature—parametrized by a length scale $L$—alter the internal dynamics of galaxies?
- **Methodology:** The authors use spherical Jeans modeling with Bayesian inference to analyze kinematic data from three ultra-diffuse galaxies (ranging from dark matter-deficient to dark matter-dominated systems), testing multiple dark matter halo profiles and orbital anisotropy models.
- **Key result:** The analysis finds no preference for non-zero coupling, yielding only upper limits on $L$; all inferred astrophysical parameters remain consistent with standard General Relativity.
- **Implication:** Any non-minimal coupling effects must be small and perturbative at galactic scales, though future high-precision velocity measurements could potentially reveal signatures in low-acceleration environments.

### [Zel'dovich smearing approximation of the BAO feature for model-agnostic cosmological inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14533)

**Authors:** Aseem Paranjape, Ravi K. Sheth
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

- **Motivation**: Current analyses of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) rely on theoretical templates tied to specific cosmological models, potentially biasing tests of alternative physics or gravity.
- **Approach**: A template-free framework that uses the Zel'dovich approximation to model—without cosmological assumptions—nonlinear bulk flow smearing, anisotropic redshift-space distortions, and scale-dependent galaxy bias.
- **Results**: Validated against $N$-body simulations and realistic mock galaxy surveys, the method accurately recovers the BAO feature and yields unbiased, precise cosmological constraints even with significant nonlinear evolution.
- **Impact**: This completes a data-ready pipeline for model-agnostic cosmological inference from large-scale structure, enabling robust, assumption-free constraints from current and future galaxy surveys.

### [J-PAS: Semi-Supervised Sim-to-Obs Transfer for Robust Star--Galaxy--Quasar Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13902)

**Authors:** Daniel López-Cano, L. Raul Abramo, L. Nakazono, I. Pérez-Ràfols, G. Martínez-Solaeche, J. Chaves-Montero, Matthew M. Pieri, Jailson Alcaniz, et al. (31 total)
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

- **Problem:** Machine learning classifiers trained on simulated astronomical data suffer significant performance losses when applied to real observations due to "domain shifts" in instrumentation, calibration, and unmodeled physics.

- **Method:** The authors use semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) to transfer a four-class spectral classifier (stars, galaxies, low- and high-redshift quasars) from abundant J-PAS mock catalogs to real observations, leveraging only a small labeled subset of target data.

- **Key Result:** The approach achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.82, outperforming both mock-only (0.73) and real-data-only (0.79) baselines. The largest gains appear in high-redshift quasar classification, where the F1 score jumps to 0.66 compared to 0.55 or 0.37 for the baselines.

- **Significance:** This demonstrates that modest supervision in the target domain enables robust, data-efficient transfer from simulations to observations, providing better-calibrated source catalogs for spectroscopic follow-up and AGN searches when real labels are scarce.

### [Upper limit on HF(1-0) absorption in a dusty star-forming galaxy at $z = 6$: Constraints on early fluorine enrichment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12885)

**Authors:** Akiyoshi Tsujita, Chiaki Kobayashi, Yuki Yoshimura, Kotaro Kohno, Ken-ichi Tadaki, Fumiya Maeda, Hideki Umehata, Shuo Huang, et al. (13 total)
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

The nucleosynthetic origin of fluorine remains uncertain, with Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars hypothesized as key producers in the early Universe. To test this, the authors searched for hydrogen fluoride (HF) absorption in a young, dusty galaxy at $z=6$ (just 0.9 billion years after the Big Bang) using ALMA, selecting a system too young for low-mass AGB stars to have contributed. They report a non-detection, deriving a conservative upper limit of $N_\mathrm{HF}/N_\mathrm{H_2} < 2.2\times10^{-9}$—about ten times lower than typical local measurements—indicating inefficient fluorine enrichment at this early epoch. This constraint favors chemical evolution models without WR yields, suggesting that massive stars had not yet significantly produced fluorine when the Universe was less than one billion years old.

### [Bayesian Cosmic Void Finding with Graph Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14630)

**Authors:** Leander Thiele
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

Cosmic void identification from sparse galaxy surveys is fundamentally probabilistic, yet traditional algorithms yield deterministic catalogs that ignore this uncertainty. This work presents a Bayesian solution using deep graph neural networks and flow matching to sample the stochastic mapping between galaxy distributions and arbitrary void definitions. When trained on a deterministic teacher, the model produces void catalogs with superior cosmological information, leveraging its inherent stochasticity as beneficial regularization. The method enables both efficient emulation of existing void finders and, crucially, Bayes-optimal mappings from observed galaxies to any void definition—including those based on underlying matter density fields.

### [Multiscale feature integration network for inpainting of full-sky CMB $B$-modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14547)

**Authors:** Reyhan D. Lambaga, Vipin Sudevan, Pisin Chen
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

Foreground masking and incomplete sky coverage in CMB polarization observations induce mode coupling that particularly hampers searches for primordial $B$-modes, which are key probes of cosmic inflation.

The authors present SkyReconNet-P, a convolutional neural network that inpaints partial-sky polarization $(Q,U)$ maps using multiscale feature integration with standard and dilated convolutions.

The method accurately reconstructs large-scale morphology and, after simulation-based calibration of the $B$-mode power spectrum, successfully recovers cosmological parameters including tensor-to-scalar ratios down to $r \sim 10^{-3}$.

This approach offers a viable alternative to traditional cut-sky analyses, providing statistically characterized full-sky maps that benefit downstream cosmological pipelines.

### [Cosmological Simulation with Population III Stellar Feedback and Metal Enrichment I: Model Description And Convergence Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12460)

**Authors:** Bocheng Zhu, Liang Gao
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

- **Problem:** Understanding how Population III stellar feedback and metal enrichment drive the transition to Population II star formation in the early universe, and ensuring numerical convergence of these processes.

- **Method:** A new subgrid framework implemented in the moving-mesh code AREPO, combining primordial non-equilibrium chemistry, metal-line cooling, IMF-sampled stellar evolution with supernova feedback, and approximate radiative transfer, tested in $1\,{\rm cMpc}/h$ boxes from $z=127$ to $10$ with gas mass resolution $\sim10\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$.

- **Results:** The model successfully reproduces JWST-inferred Population II star formation rate densities across varied initial conditions. Metal-enriched gas achieves a volume filling factor of $\sim1\%$ by $z=10$, and results converge once subhalos exceed $10^{6.5}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ are resolved, indicating robust predictions for early stellar mass assembly.

- **Significance:** Requiring only $\sim10^4$ CPU hours per simulation, the framework is computationally efficient enough for large-volume studies and future parameter explorations of Population III IMF variations, X-ray radiation, and high-redshift streaming velocities.
