**Matched Projects:** JWST

### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The JWST EXCELS survey reveals that the downsizing trend, where more massive galaxies formed their stars earlier, was already established by redshift $z\simeq4$.

### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- The study finds a clear correlation between stellar age and stellar mass, with more massive galaxies having assembled their stars earlier, confirming the downsizing trend at $z\simeq4$.
- The slope of the age-mass correlation is $\simeq1.5$ Gyr per dex in stellar mass, consistent with previous findings at lower redshifts ($0 < z < 3$).
- No quiescent galaxies with $\log_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})\lesssim10.5$ and ages over a few hundred Myr were observed at this epoch, suggesting that recently reported higher-redshift quiescent galaxies at these masses might rejuvenate.
- Detailed stellar chemical abundances for the earliest quiescent galaxies remain challenging to infer, with significant disagreements arising from different stellar population models and fitting methods.

### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational:**
- **Methodologies:** The study uses deep, medium-resolution $λ=1-5\,μ$m JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for 14 quiescent galaxies at $3<z<5$ with $\log_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}){\,>\,}10$. The data underwent a complete re-reduction, including a custom optimal-extraction approach to address undersampling issues in the NIRSpec spatial PSF. Full-spectral fitting was used to constrain star-formation histories and stellar metallicities.

### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The paper proposes a simple analytical model explaining the formation of disk galaxies, suggesting that disks form when the gravitational potential steepens due to baryon accumulation, and validates this model against the TNG50 cosmological simulation.

### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- The model predicts that disk galaxies form when the gravitational potential steepens due to the accumulation of baryons in the halo center, with the minimum galaxy mass for this transition decreasing with increasing dark matter contribution.
- The model explains the observed increase in the critical halo mass for disk formation with redshift as a consequence of the evolution of halo mass-concentration and baryonic mass-halo mass relations.
- The study validates the model against the TNG50 cosmological simulation, finding remarkable agreement despite the model's simplicity.
- This work supports the idea that the steepening of the gravitational potential is a key driver for disk formation, aligning with broader discussions on galaxy-halo interactions and the transition from turbulent to dynamically cold disks.

### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**If theoretical:**
- **Core logic and main methods:** The paper develops an analytical model where galaxy morphology is determined by the competition between rotational support and turbulence within the gravitational potential of dark matter halos and the galaxy itself.
- **Does it derive analytic expressions?** Yes, the model derives expressions for the conditions under which disks form and how galaxy sizes behave before and after disk formation.
- **Does it build a theoretical model/picture?** Yes, it constructs a theoretical framework linking galaxy morphology to the properties of dark matter halos and baryonic accumulation.

### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS

**Matched Projects:** JWST

### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
JWST spatially resolved observations of three merging Lyman-α emitter systems at $z \sim 3-4$ reveal that while mergers generate significant structural perturbations and dust disturbances, they do not trigger starburst activity or obscure older stellar populations, suggesting that morphological complexity rather than enhanced star formation drives the observed Lyα emission properties.

### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main result:** Despite ongoing merger activity (two minor mergers, one major merger), all three systems lie on the star-forming main sequence with close agreement between spatially resolved and integrated stellar mass estimates, indicating that recent star formation does not significantly outshine older stellar populations and that starburst activity has not been triggered.
- **Methodology highlight:** Analysis of three high signal-to-noise merging LAEs at $3 < z < 4$ selected from the VLT/MUSE-Deep survey in GOODS-S, combining new JWST/NIRCam broadband and medium-band imaging with archival HST/ACS data to perform spatially resolved SED fitting using the \textsc{Bagpipes} software package.
- **Unexpected result:** The detection of prominent color gradients and disturbed dust distributions in merging systems that nevertheless show no elevated star formation activity, challenging the assumption that morphological disturbances necessarily correlate with starburst phases in high-redshift galaxies.
- **Connection to broader field:** The structural perturbations (gas redistribution, reduced neutral hydrogen covering fraction) may facilitate Lyα photon escape mechanisms, providing a potential explanation for the high Lyα equivalent widths observed in LAEs without requiring extreme star formation rates or special stellar populations.

### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational study** combining high-resolution imaging with spatially resolved stellar population synthesis.

- **Brief summary of key methodologies:** Targets are three merging LAE systems selected from the MUSE-Deep survey based on high S/N Lyα detection and clear morphological disturbances. The team performed pixel-by-pixel SED fitting using \textsc{Bagpipes} to derive spatially resolved stellar masses, star

### [Growth of High-Redshift Quasars from Fermion Dark Matter Seeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05135v1)

**arXiv:** [2602.05135](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05135)
**PDF:** [Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05135v1)
**Authors:** Yu Wang, Remo Ruffini
**Categories:** astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE
**Published:** 2026-02-04
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

**Matched Topics:** High-redshift galaxies and their formation, especially on the population of submillimeter galaxies (SMG), Lyman-break galaxies (LBG), Lyman-alpha emitters (LAE), and Little Red Dots (LRD), The nature of dark matter and its impact on galaxy evolution, Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution

### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The paper proposes that massive seed black holes with initial masses around $10^{6}\,M_\odot$, formed at $z\sim20{-}30$ from quantum-degenerate fermion dark matter cores, can explain the growth of high-redshift quasars without requiring sustained Eddington accretion or super-Eddington episodes.

### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main result with specific numbers/values if given:** The initial seed black holes are inferred to have masses around $10^{6}\,M_\odot$, formed at redshifts $z\sim20{-}30$ in environments with baryonic overdensity factors $f_ρ\gtrsim 50$ relative to the cosmic mean.
- **Methodology highlight (data used, sample size, redshift range):** The study uses Bayesian inference to fit the observed masses and luminosities of two high-redshift quasars, J0313--1806 ($z=7.64$) and J0100+2802 ($z=6.30$).
- **Unexpected or surprising result (if any):** The inferred seed mass scale is consistent with black holes produced by the collapse of quantum-degenerate fermion dark matter cores, providing a new pathway to massive seeds at high redshifts.
- **Connection to broader field (how does this change what we know?):** This work challenges traditional growth scenarios that start from light seeds and suggests a new mechanism for the formation of massive black holes in the early universe, potentially resolving the puzzle of high-redshift quasars.

### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper type:** Theoretical

**Core logic and main methods:**
The authors model the accretion history of black holes as the smaller of the Bondi inflow rate and the Eddington-limited rate. The Bondi rate is determined by the supply of overdense primordial gas, which declines with cosmic expansion, while the Eddington rate captures the regulation by radiative feedback. They use Bayesian inference to fit the observed properties of two high-redshift quasars, J0313--1806 ($z=7.64$) and J0100+2802 ($z=6.30$), to infer the initial conditions of the black holes.

**Does it derive analytic expressions?**
Yes, the paper derives expressions for the Bondi accretion rate and the Eddington-limited accretion rate.

**Does it build a theoretical model/picture?**
Yes, the paper builds a theoretical model for the growth of black holes in high-redshift environments, considering the interplay between gas supply and radiative feedback.

The study uses JWST ASPIRE data to measure the clustering of [O III] emitters and quasars at z~6.6, finding that the UV-luminous phase contributes little to total supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth, placing tight constraints on early black-hole formation.

### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main Result:** The inferred minimum host halo masses are $\log(M_{h,\text{min}}^{\text{[O,III]}}/M_\odot)=10.5^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ for [O III] emitters and $\log(M_{h,\text{min}}^{\text{QSO}}/M_\odot)=12.1^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ for quasars. Duty cycles are $2.5^{+1.0}_{-0.8}\%$ for [O III] emitters and $0.3^{+4.0}_{-0.3}\%$ for quasars, corresponding to UV-bright lifetimes of $t_{\text{Q}}=2.6^{+30}_{-2.5}$ Myr.
- **Methodology Highlight:** The study uses data from the JWST ASPIRE Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) program, covering 25 fields with redshifts 5.3 < z < 7.0 for [O III] emitters and 6.51 < z < 6.82 for quasars.
- **Unexpected Result:** The UV-luminous phase contributes little to total SMBH growth, indicating that this phase is a small fraction of the overall black hole growth.

### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
A detailed mass modelling analysis of 11 nearby galaxies from the GARCIA survey reveals that while cuspy (NFW) and cored (Burkert, pISO) dark matter halo profiles all provide statistically acceptable fits to the rotation curves, non-parametric density decompositions surprisingly indicate that NFW profiles best describe the inner regions, though all profiles converge in the outskirts.

### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Degeneracy in profile fitting:** All four tested dark matter halo models—NFW (cuspy), Einasto (intermediate), Burkert (cored), and pseudo-isothermal/pISO (cored)—yield statistically good fits to the rotation curve data, producing consistent estimates of halo mass ($M_{\rm halo}$) and stellar mass-to-light ratio ($\Upsilon_*$), suggesting the current data cannot definitively distinguish between cuspy and cored profiles in this sample.
- **Sophisticated baryonic modelling:** The analysis incorporates stellar mass distributions derived from 3.6$\mu$m or $r$-band photometry using Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) combined with the Jeans Anisotropic Model (JAM), plus gas mass calculated directly from HI+He surface density without assuming predefined functional forms, representing a rigorous treatment of baryonic contributions.
- **Unexpected inner profile behavior:** Non-parametric dark matter density profiles derived from baryon-subtracted rotation curves indicate that NFW (cuspy) profiles fit the inner regions ($r \lesssim$ few kpc) better than cored alternatives, contrary to the classic cusp-core problem narrative for low-surface-brightness systems, though the profiles become indistinguishable in the outer halos.
- **Validation and broader context:** The derived stellar-to-halo mass relation shows broad agreement with empirical models (e.g., Moster et al., Behroozi et al.), validating the mass modelling methodology, but the small pilot sample ($N=11$) limits definitive conclusions about the cusp-core controversy pending larger GARCIA samples.

The paper investigates the constraints on cosmic inflation models with a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) $M$ using the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck. The authors establish new limits on $M$, finding $\log_{10}M/M_{Pl}=-2.5^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$ at the 68% confidence level, which is significant for post-inflationary processes like preheating. They also conduct lattice simulations to explore the production of relics such as oscillons, which could be detected by future experiments, although the gravitational waves produced are in a frequency range not easily accessible by current detectors. This research matters as it provides updated constraints on inflationary parameters and offers insights into potential observable signatures from early universe physics.

Turyshev examines the nature of dark energy using data from the DESI Data Release 2 (DR2), focusing on the interplay between Type Ia supernovae, anisotropic BAO, CMB calibration, and perturbation-sensitive probes like RSD and weak lensing. The study provides detailed diagnostics, including an \( r_d \)-independent BAO-shape observable \( F_{\rm AP}(z) \) and a linear-response map for SN Hubble-diagram systematics, to improve the interpretation of dark energy parameters. Key findings include a mild parameter mismatch in flat \( \Lambda \)CDM models and a preference for evolving dark energy models, though the preference is sensitive to redshift-dependent SN calibration residuals. This work is significant as it sharpens our understanding of dark energy dynamics and provides robust tools for future cosmological surveys.

The paper "Testing cosmic anisotropy with cluster scaling relations" by Tariq Yasin and colleagues investigates whether there is large-scale anisotropy in the local expansion rate of the universe using cluster scaling relations as distance indicators. The authors employ a Bayesian forward model to jointly fit the X-ray luminosity-temperature and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-temperature relations, accounting for latent cluster distances, selection effects, and peculiar velocities. They apply this method to 312 clusters at redshifts \( z \lesssim 0.2 \) and test for dipolar, quadrupolar, and general anisotropy models. The key finding is that there is no more than weak evidence for any anisotropic model, with upper limits of \( \delta H_0 / H_0 < 3.2\% \) for dipole models and bulk flow magnitude \( < 1300\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}} \). This result contrasts with previous claims of significant anisotropy from the same data, highlighting the importance of accurately modeling peculiar velocities when testing isotropy with distance indicators.

The paper "Does Cosmology require Hermiticity in Quantum Mechanics?" by Oem Trivedi and Alfredo Gurrola investigates whether the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically Hermiticity, are necessary in the context of quantum cosmology. The authors extend the Wheeler DeWitt framework to include non-Hermitian dynamics and use a controlled semiclassical reduction to analyze how anti-Hermitian contributions affect both early universe primordial fluctuations and late-time structure growth. They find that these contributions manifest as effective damping or gain terms, and by comparing their framework with inflationary observables and the observed near flatness of the universe, they derive strong infrared constraints that suppress non-Hermiticity across cosmic history. This work suggests that Hermiticity may dynamically emerge along the semiclassical branch describing our universe, highlighting cosmology as a new testing ground for foundational aspects of quantum mechanics.

The paper investigates whether dynamical dark energy models with a negative cosmological constant can explain the early presence of massive black holes (BHs) with masses \( M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^7\,M_{\odot} \) observed at redshifts \( z \gtrsim 8 \) and the over-abundance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) relative to expectations in the standard \( \Lambda \)CDM model. The authors develop an analytic framework to link the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs under the assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial BH seeds with mass \( M_{seed} \sim 10^2\,M_{\odot} \). They find that models with \( \Omega_{\Lambda} \approx -1 \) can account for these observations, simultaneously boosting galaxy and AGN counts without invoking additional physics. This suggests that the excess of bright galaxies and early formation of massive BHs could have a common cosmological origin, potentially resolving discrepancies highlighted by recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope.

The paper "Microlensing constraint on Primordial Black Hole abundance with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam observations of Andromeda" by Sunao Sugiyama et al. investigates the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a component of dark matter using microlensing observations. The authors analyze high-cadence data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam observations of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) collected over multiple years, identifying 12 microlensing candidates with light-curve timescales shorter than 5 hours. Employing a hierarchical Bayesian framework, they derive constraints on PBH parameters, finding that the inferred mass scale is approximately $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-6} M_\odot$ and the PBH abundance to total dark matter is around $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-1}$. This study underscores the potential of HSC-M31 monitoring to probe PBHs and highlights the need for further research using upcoming observations from facilities like the Rubin Observatory LSST.

The paper titled "Bayesian imaging inverse problem with scattering transform" by Sébastien Pierre and colleagues addresses the challenge of solving Bayesian imaging inverse problems in astrophysics and cosmology, especially in scenarios with limited data and complex forward operators. The authors introduce a Bayesian approach that leverages a low-dimensional representation of physical fields using Scattering Transform statistics, enabling efficient inference in a compact model space. They propose an iterative adaptive algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution over signal models consistent with observed data. Applied to a large-scale structure column density field from the Quijote simulations, their method achieves accurate statistical inference and deterministic signal reconstruction from a single contaminated image, without relying on external prior distributions. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of Scattering Transform statistics for solving complex imaging inverse problems in low-data regimes, opening new avenues for analyzing non-Gaussian astrophysical and cosmological signals with minimal prior modeling.

The paper presents a practical, parallel version of Dehnen's momentum-conserving Cartesian fast multipole method for computing gravitational forces in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with adaptive gravitational force softening. The authors parallelize the dual tree walk by replicating node-node interactions on parent nodes, simplifying parallelization and allowing integration with the existing non-conservative force algorithm in the Phantom code. This new method conserves linear momentum to machine precision, maintains similar force accuracy and computational performance as the previous method, and improves angular momentum and orbital phase conservation in binary polytrope evolutions. This advancement enhances the accuracy and efficiency of self-gravity calculations in SPH simulations, making it the default method in the public Phantom code.

The paper titled "The kinematic cosmic dipole beyond Ellis and Baldwin" by Albert Bonnefous addresses the challenge posed by the cosmic dipole anomaly, which is detected at over 5σ significance in multiple surveys and questions the standard cosmological model. Bonnefous generalizes the Ellis & Baldwin formula, which links the dipole anisotropy in extragalactic light sources to the observer's velocity, to accommodate arbitrary luminosity distributions and spectral profiles. Applying this generalized formula to quasars observed in the W1 band of the CatWISE survey, the study confirms that the cosmic dipole anomaly persists even beyond the power-law assumptions. This work provides a more robust framework for interpreting cosmic dipole measurements in future large-scale surveys, enhancing our understanding of cosmological anomalies.

The paper "Forecast on $f(R)$ Gravity with HI 21cm Intensity Mapping Surveys" by Yanling Song et al. investigates how future neutral hydrogen (HI) 21 cm intensity mapping (IM) observations can constrain $f(R)$ gravity, a modified gravity theory that extends General Relativity and potentially explains the Universe's accelerated expansion. The authors use Fisher-matrix forecasts to analyze the sensitivity of upcoming 21 cm IM experiments, such as BINGO and SKA1-MID, to the Compton wavelength parameter $B_0$, which quantifies deviations from General Relativity. They find that BINGO can place bounds on $B_0$ with a standard deviation of approximately $2.27 \times 10^{-6}$, while SKA1-MID Band 2 offers the tightest constraints with a standard deviation of about $6.37 \times 10^{-8}$. Importantly, combining low-redshift 21 cm IM data with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations from Planck significantly improves the constraints on $B_0$ by breaking degeneracies with other cosmological parameters. This work underscores the potential of HI intensity mapping surveys, in conjunction with CMB measurements, to provide robust tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales.

The paper "Fractal dimension of the cosmic web with different galaxy types" by Ana Elisa Lima et al. investigates how different galaxy color types trace the cosmic web's large-scale structure across various redshifts. The authors use a $NUVrK$-complete COSMOS2020 subsample of 618,952 galaxies observed up to $z=4$ and plot number densities against luminosity and comoving distances to estimate the fractal dimension $D$ for blue, green, and red galaxies in two redshift intervals: $z\gtrless1$. They find that the fractal dimension varies with galaxy color, showing a gradient $D_{\mathrm{blue}}> D_{\mathrm{red}}>D_{\mathrm{green}}$ for $z<1$ and $D_{\mathrm{blue}}>D_{\mathrm{green}}D_{\mathrm{red}}$ for $1<z\leq4$, with values ranging from 0.03 to 2.03. These results highlight the fractal dimension as a sensitive diagnostic tool for mapping the evolving cosmic web and understanding how different galaxy populations trace its structure.

The paper investigates whether a single disc-crossing event by the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy can explain the large-scale perturbations observed in the Milky Way's disc, including spiral arms, disc corrugations, and other features. The authors use simulations of a Sagittarius-like perturber crossing the Milky Way disc to analyze the formation of these structures. They find that a single crossing event can reasonably reproduce the observed local disc corrugation and several spiral arm segments, suggesting that the last significant crossing occurred 700-1200 million years ago. While the simulations also produce structures resembling the $L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave and phase spiral, they do not match these features in detail, indicating that additional triggers, such as the Galactic bar or interactions with other satellites, are necessary to fully explain the current dynamical state of the Milky Way's disc. This study provides insights into the role of external perturbations in shaping galactic structures and highlights the complexity of galactic dynamics.

The paper investigates how the environmental modulation of individual galaxy bias within cosmic voids depends on the void-finding algorithm used. The authors apply five distinct void-finding methods—spherical voids, watershed-based methods, and free-form integrated-density voids—to the same galaxy sample from the IllustrisTNG simulation (TNG300-1 at \( z=0 \)) and compute individual galaxy bias profiles as a function of distance from void centers. They find that while the radial gradient of individual bias within voids is robust across most definitions, density-threshold methods preferentially select galaxies with negative bias, and watershed methods without density constraints include significant contamination from high-bias boundary galaxies. This study matters because understanding the relationship between galaxy bias and void membership is crucial for accurately interpreting cosmological observations and simulations.

The paper "Shocks, Winds, and a Torus: The Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) Resolves the Active Nucleus of NGC 4151" by Jacob W. Isbell et al. investigates the structure and dynamics of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151 using high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) observations from the LBTI. The authors employed open-loop Fizeau imaging at 66-104 mas resolution in the N-band and AO imaging in the LM-bands, achieving resolutions equivalent to a 28.8 m telescope. They resolved a dusty torus with a diameter of 32 pc and detected dusty clouds within the narrow line region, finding evidence for both accretion disk heating and additional shock heating from the radio jet. This study highlights the need to revise MIR radiative transfer models of AGN to account for jet-related heating and supports the Unified Model of AGN by comparing NGC 4151 with NGC 1068, showing similar structures despite differences in orientation and Eddington ratio.

In the paper "Wising up to CatWISE: using simulation-based inference to interpret the ecliptic bias and confirm the cosmic dipole excess," Oliver T. Oayda and Geraint F. Lewis address the cosmic dipole problem using the CatWISE2020 sample. They apply Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to measure the distribution of quasar counts across the sky, revealing that the quadrupole anisotropy in CatWISE is due to the correlation between WISE's scanning law and photometric uncertainty in the $W1$ and $W2$ magnitudes, which induces an Eddington bias that varies with sky position. Using a neural likelihood estimator, they confirm the presence of a cosmic dipole twice as large as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) expectation and more seriously misaligned with the CMB direction ($\approx 3 σ$). This study highlights the potential of SBI to untangle complex systematic issues in astronomical data, providing insights into the persistent cosmic dipole excess problem for the $\Lambda$CDM model.

The authors employ N-body simulations and a genetic algorithm to determine the initial positions and velocities of the Magellanic Clouds, aiming to reproduce their current observed locations and velocities. Their best matching model includes two close interactions between the LMC and SMC, occurring approximately 940 million and 140 million years ago, and successfully reproduces several observed features such as the LMC disc warp and a ring-shaped overdensity in the LMC. This research provides crucial insights into the dynamical history of these satellite galaxies and their interactions with the Milky Way, enhancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of these stellar substructures.

The paper "Multi-spin stellar velocity maps of the most massive galaxies" by Davor Krajnovic et al. investigates the stellar kinematics of 25 very massive galaxies in the Shapley super cluster, focusing on differences between brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and non-BCGs. Using data from the MUSE M3G Survey, the authors create detailed velocity maps revealing complex kinematic structures, including multiple spin reversals and both prograde and retrograde orbital families in some galaxies. They find that fast rotators are typically non-BCGs ranked below the third brightest, while slow rotators are often BCGs or second-ranked galaxies, suggesting that environment plays a role in spin. Additionally, some BCGs show evidence of secondary components likely from accreted stars, highlighting different evolutionary paths for BCGs and non-BCGs.

The paper investigates the enrichment and role of hydrocarbons in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, focusing on the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 07251-0248. Using JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS infrared observations, the authors detect a variety of small gas-phase hydrocarbons, including benzene, triacetylene, diacetylene, acetylene, methane, and methyl radical, as well as amorphous C-H absorptions in the solid phase. The unexpectedly high abundance of these molecules suggests that they originate from the erosion and fragmentation of carbonaceous grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), rather than from high-temperature gas-phase chemistry or other processes. This finding is significant because it provides new insights into the chemical processes occurring in deeply obscured galactic nuclei and suggests that IRAS 07251-0248 may represent an extreme example of a common phenomenon in such environments.

The paper titled "An emulator for the ionizing photon mean free path in ultra-high resolution simulations: the implications of mean free path measurements for the reionization history" by Hurum Maksora Tohfa, Christopher Cain, Matthew McQuinn, and Anson D'Aloisio addresses the challenge of interpreting measurements of the mean free path (MFP) of ionizing photons from high-redshift quasar spectra to understand the reionization history of the universe. The authors develop a deep learning emulator using a residual multi-layer perceptron neural network trained on high-resolution cosmological radiative transfer simulations. This emulator predicts the MFP as a function of reionization redshift, photoionization rate, wavelength, and box-scale density, achieving a median relative error of 1.6% across a wide range of MFP values. The emulator's predictions suggest a late reionization scenario with substantial neutral fractions persisting at redshifts less than 6, and a midpoint of reionization at \( z_{\rm re} = 6.8 \pm 1.2 \). This method offers an efficient alternative to large-volume radiative-hydrodynamic simulations, providing more converged results and serving as a subgrid prescription for ionizing opacity in such simulations, thus enhancing our understanding of the reionization process.

The FLAMINGO Project explores the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation as a novel probe of large-scale cosmic structure, focusing on how baryonic feedback processes, particularly from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), influence the distribution of gas in galaxy groups and clusters. Using the FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, the authors analyze the cross-correlation's sensitivity to gas distribution in haloes with masses between \(10^{14}\) and \(10^{15}\) solar masses. They find that while the cross-correlation is sensitive to feedback strength, variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. Comparing FLAMINGO predictions with observational data from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps, they conclude that resolving fainter AGN and using external constraints are crucial to fully exploit the potential of this cross-correlation as a probe. This work highlights the importance of accurate AGN modeling and external constraints in understanding the interplay between baryonic feedback and large-scale structure.

The paper titled "ELFO: A Python package for emission line fitting optimization in integral field spectroscopy data" by Hui Guo et al. addresses the issue of spatial discontinuities in emission line fitting for integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data. The authors introduce ELFO, a Python package that optimizes the fitting process by using neighboring spectra to generate multiple initial guesses and selecting the fit that exhibits spatial smoothness. Tested on IFS data from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, ELFO successfully corrected anomalous fits, revealed previously unresolved substructures, and made large-scale kinematic structures more evident. This method, which can be easily adapted to other IFS data and emission lines, enhances the accuracy and reliability of IFS data analysis, crucial for detailed studies of the interstellar medium's physical and kinematic properties.

The paper "Direction-dependent calibration with image-domain gridding" by van der Tol et al. addresses the challenge of correcting direction-dependent systematic errors in wide-field radio interferometer images, which are typically caused by factors like the ionosphere and beam pattern. The authors propose a novel calibration method using image-domain gridding, which replaces the traditional discrete direction-based calibration with a continuous model in Fourier space. This approach eliminates the need for additional smoothing and mosaicing operations, thereby avoiding discontinuities in the error model. The study demonstrates improved image quality using LOFAR data, highlighting the physical plausibility of the new method compared to the piecewise constant model traditionally used. This advancement is significant as it enhances the accuracy and reliability of wide-field radio astronomy observations.

MESS extends the TODCOR method to a global multi-epoch formalism, optimizing templates across all observations and searching an eight-dimensional parameter space for effective temperature, surface gravity, rotational broadening, metallicity, and flux ratio. Validated on 1500 simulated LAMOST MRS systems with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, MESS achieves a classification accuracy of approximately 95% and successfully derives full orbital solutions for two SB2 systems, including one with a faint secondary. This method is significant as it enhances the detection and analysis of binary systems, which are crucial for understanding stellar evolution and dynamics.

### [Establishing a relationship between the cosmological 21 cm power spectrum and interferometric closure phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04965v1)

The paper "Establishing a relationship between the cosmological 21 cm power spectrum and interferometric closure phases" by Pascal M. Keller, Bojan Nikolic, and Nithyanandan Thyagarajan addresses the challenge of isolating the cosmic 21 cm signal from bright foreground emissions in radio astronomy. The authors propose using calibration-independent closure phases to detect the spectral fluctuations of the cosmic 21 cm signal, establishing a mathematical relationship between these closure phases and the cosmological power spectrum. They use a delay spectrum approach and Fourier transform techniques to validate this relationship with simulated HERA observations. The key finding is that the power spectrum estimate from closure phases is approximately equal to the cosmological power spectrum convolved with a foreground-dependent window function, which introduces more mode-mixing and foreground power proliferation. This mapping is crucial for improving sensitivity and averaging measurements from different closure triads, enhancing the detection of the cosmic 21 cm signal.

The paper titled "Classifying white dwarfs from multi-object spectroscopy surveys with machine learning" by James Munday et al. addresses the challenge of efficiently classifying white dwarf spectral types from large datasets generated by multi-object spectroscopic surveys. The authors develop a neural network that uses spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and imaging from Pan-STARRS photometry to classify white dwarfs, achieving near 100% accuracy for DA and DB types and 85-95% accuracy for other primary types. They also employ Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction, discovering three new 'double-faced' white dwarfs with changing spectral signatures. This work demonstrates the power of machine learning to automate and enhance the analysis of white dwarf populations, potentially replacing human-driven classifications and facilitating batch population analyses, rare subclass detection, and multi-epoch spectral studies.
