### [Highly Efficient Selection of High-Redshift Emission-Line Galaxies for future DESI-like surveys with Deep Multi-band Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20405)

**Authors:** Yoquelbin Salcedo Hernandez, Jeffrey A. Newman, Brett. H. Andrews, Biprateep Dey, Rongpu. Zhou, Noah Sailer, J. Aguilar, S. Ahlen, et al. (56 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The authors develop a new color-based selection technique using deep multi-band imaging that significantly improves the targeting efficiency of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) at $z=1.1$–$1.6$, potentially reducing BAO measurement uncertainties by a factor of two compared to current methods.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Performance Improvement:** The new selection method achieves a redshift measurement success rate of 89% and a correct redshift range success rate of 84%, compared to 69% and 34% respectively for current DESI ELG selections.
- **Increased Yield:** The net surface density yield is more than doubled, reaching 1372 $\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$ versus the current 660 $\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$.
- **Methodology:** The authors used a probabilistic random forest classifier trained on HSC $grizy$ photometry and COSMOS2020 photometric redshifts to derive simple color cuts, which were then empirically refined using DESI spectroscopic samples.
- **Cosmological Impact:** Combining this sample with current DESI ELGs would increase net ELG number density by a factor of $\sim3$, moving the survey out of the shot-noise limited regime and reducing uncertainties on the BAO scale parameter at $z=1.1$–$1.6$ by a factor of $\sim2$.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational Paper**

- **Methodology:** The study utilizes deep optical photometry to isolate high-redshift ELGs. A probabilistic random forest guides the initial definition of color-color space regions, which are then simplified into operational "color cuts." These cuts are validated and refined using deep spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to ensure high purity and completeness.
- **Key Metrics:** The "correct redshift range success rate" is a critical metric introduced, ensuring that selected galaxies not only yield a redshift but fall specifically within the desired $z=1.1$–$1.6$ window for cosmological analysis.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Target Redshift Range | $z = 1.1 - 1.6$ |
| Imaging Data | Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) $grizy$ |
| Spectroscopic Validation | Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) |
| Photometric Reference | COSMOS2020 catalog |
| Net Yield Improvement | $\sim3\times$ increase in number density (combined) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **Datasets:**
    - Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey data
    - COSMOS2020 catalog (many-band photometric redshifts)
    - DESI spectroscopic data
- **Tools:**
    - Probabilistic Random Forest (pRF) classifier

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **ELGs as Cosmological Tracers:** Emission-line galaxies are essential tracers for Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Large Scale Structure (LSS) at redshifts $z > 1$, a critical epoch for probing dark energy.
- **Survey Limitations:** Current surveys like DESI are often shot-noise limited at $z > 1$ due to the difficulty of efficiently selecting targets that yield secure redshifts in the desired range; improving target density is more cost-effective than increasing exposure times for individual fibers.
- **Role of Deep Imaging:** Deep, wide-area multi-band imaging (anticipated from the Rubin Observatory) provides the necessary color resolution to separate high-redshift ELGs from lower-redshift interlopers more effectively than broad-band photometric methods used in previous surveys.

### [Machine-learning cosmological parameters by eROSITA data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20483)

**Authors:** Fucheng Zhong, Nicola R. Napolitano, Johan Comparat, Klaus Dolag, Caroline Heneka, Zhiqi Huang, Xiaodong Li, Weipeng Lin, et al. (11 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.5/10

Context: We present the first Cosmological Parameter inferences from eROSITA X-ray observations of galaxy clusters using a Machine Learning algorithm. Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $\sigma_8=0.81\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $\Omega_{\rm m}-\sigma_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model.

### [Little Red Dots: One Photometric Tag Concealing Diverse Spectroscopic Flavors of Massive Star Formation and Black Hole Activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20247)

**Authors:** Pablo G. P\'erez-Gonz\'alez, Guillermo Barro, Stefano Carniani, Francesco D'Eugenio, George H. Rieke, Roberta Tripodi, Andrew J. Bunker, Xihan Ji, et al. (65 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
JWST spectroscopy of 249 Little Red Dots reveals they are not a uniform population but diverse composite systems hosting actively accreting black holes and young, compact starbursts embedded in dense gas.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
*   **Main Result:** LRDs are heterogeneous systems with derived masses of $M_{BH}\sim10^{6.0-6.5}~M_\odot$ and $M_\bigstar\sim10^{8.3}~M_\odot$ (BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 1-2%), exhibiting both sub-Eddington accretion ($\lambda_{Edd}=0.6\pm0.2$) and significant stellar contributions (up to $\sim80$% in the far-UV for the bluest systems).
*   **Methodology Highlight:** The study utilizes a representative spectroscopic subset of 249 NIRCam-selected LRDs ($2.3 < z < 9.3$), analyzing median-stacked spectra and four subsample stacks based on optical-to-UV luminosity ratios.
*   **Unexpected/Surprising Result:** The detection of potential Wolf-Rayet features (HeII$\lambda$4687, nitrogen lines) and an absorption feature at $\sim4550$ Angstrom suggests the presence of a young (3-7 Myr) compact starburst possibly dominated by super-massive stars ($\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{SMS}\sim10^{5}~M_\odot$), a claim that requires verification.
*   **Connection to Broader Field:** This challenges the simplified view of LRDs as either purely AGN or passive galaxies, positioning them as objects caught in a short-lived ($\lesssim20$ Myr) phase of co-evolution involving intense BH activity and nuclear star formation within high-density, warm gas environments.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational Study:**
The study compiles JWST spectroscopic and photometric data to construct rest-frame spectral energy distributions (SEDs). It employs spectral stacking to boost signal-to-noise for continuum and line analysis, fitting the resulting SEDs with models assuming a central super-massive black hole surrounded by dense gas clouds and a stellar component.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | N = 249 |
| Redshift range | z = 2.3 – 9.3 |
| Key instruments | JWST/NIRSpec (Prism), JWST/MIRI, JWST/NIRCam (selection) |
| Data products | Median stacked spectrum (rest-frame 0.09–1.2 $\mu$m), MIRI photometry (extending to 4 $\mu$m) |
| Key physical conditions | Gas density: High; Temp: 4000–7000 K; Accretion: $\lambda_{Edd}=0.6\pm0.2$ |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
*   **Datasets:** JWST/NIRSpec Prism data; JWST/MIRI photometry.
*   **Software/URLs:** No specific software tools or repository URLs are listed in the provided abstract.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*   LRDs are defined photometrically by their compact size and red colors, but their physical nature—whether dominated by AGN, obscured star formation, or other phenomena—remains a subject of active debate.
*   The introduction likely highlights the tension between the high number density of these massive, compact objects at high redshift and theoretical models of galaxy and black hole formation.
*   A key focus is the "v-shaped" spectral energy distribution (SED) typical of LRDs, which presents a challenge to standard dust attenuation models and necessitates the exploration of dense gas effects and composite models.

### [The First Systematic Survey of Stellar Halos in High-Inclination Galaxies Reveals Unusually Quiescent Merger Histories of Nearby Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20258)

**Authors:** Bojun Tao, Hong-Xin Zhang, Wenting Wang, Enci Wang, Guangwen Chen, Huiyuan Wang, Lijun Chen, Qian-Hui Chen, et al. (11 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
This paper presents the first systematic survey of stellar halos in 169 high-inclination galaxies using HSC-SSP data, revealing that nearby galaxies (including the Milky Way) exhibit a significant deficit in stellar halo mass compared to the cosmic average, indicating unusually quiescent merger histories.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
*   **Main Result:** Nearby galaxies within 25 Mpc show a median stellar halo mass deficit of ~0.3 dex relative to the mean relation, implying that the Local Volume has experienced unusually quiescent merger histories compared to the broader cosmic population.
*   **Methodology:** The study analyzed 169 high-inclination central galaxies ($7.3 \le \log M_*/M_\odot \le 11.0$) using deep HSC-SSP optical images, detecting stellar halos in 93 systems via a new method focusing on low isophotal ellipticities in the outskirts.
*   **Scaling Relations:** Stellar halo mass fraction correlates with galaxy mass (reaching ~10% for Milky Way-mass galaxies) and color (driven by mass-metallicity), with higher mass galaxies hosting more extended halos indicative of more active merger histories.
*   **Cosmological Context:** The observed halo mass deficit in nearby galaxies is not an anomaly but follows a trend where stellar halo fractions increase with heliocentric distance, tracking the rise in matter density from the local under-density toward the cosmic average by $z \le 0.07$.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational Study**

*   **Methodology:** The authors utilized high-inclination (edge-on) galaxies to minimize line-of-sight contamination from the disk. They identified stellar halos primarily through a drop in isophotal ellipticity at large radii, a method that improves upon conventional surface brightness cuts by better distinguishing extended halo light from disk flaring or thick disks. They fitted surface brightness profiles with power-law models to derive halo masses and structural parameters.
*   **Quick Reference Table:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | 169 central galaxies |
| Redshift range | $z < 0.1$ |
| Mass range | $7.3 \le \log M_*/M_\odot \le 11.0$ |
| Detection Rate | 93/169 (55% overall; ~50% at $\log M_* > 9.9$) |
| Key instruments | Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) |
| Data products | HSC-SSP Deep optical images (g, r, i bands) |
| Halo fraction (MW-mass) | $10\% \pm 5\%$ |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
*   **Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP):** Deep optical imaging data used for the analysis. (URL: [hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/](https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/))
*   No specific software repositories or external databases were cited in the provided text.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*   **Stellar Halos as Probes:** Stellar halos are the least characterized major component of disk galaxies but serve as the primary fossil record of a galaxy's merger history, encoding information about accretion events over cosmic time.
*   **Observational Gaps:** Previous stellar halo studies were limited to the Local Group (M31, MW) or small samples of massive galaxies, lacking a systematic census across a wide range of stellar masses and environments.
*   **Local vs. Cosmic Context:** There is a tension between the relatively quiescent merger history inferred for the Milky Way and predictions from cosmological simulations, raising the question of whether the Local Volume is representative of the cosmic average.

*(Note: Claims regarding the correlation between halo fraction and "matter density toward the cosmic average" are based on a trend with heliocentric distance; while intriguing, this interpretation relies on the assumption that the sample selection effects are well-controlled across the distance range.)*

### [A Salpeter IMF and an NFW halo: Disentangling the dark and stellar mass through precise lens modelling of a double-source-plane system reinforces the canonical model of elliptical galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20889)

**Authors:** Tian Li, Thomas E. Collett, Coleman M. Krawczyk, Giovanni Granata, Wolfgang J. R. Enzi, Daniel J. Ballard, Natalie E. P. Lines, Ana Sainz de Murieta, et al. (10 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Precise strong lensing modeling of the double-source-plane galaxy J0946+1006 reveals that the system is best described by a canonical model consisting of a Salpeter-like stellar initial mass function and a standard NFW dark matter halo, ruling out significant radial stellar mass-to-light gradients or non-NFW dark matter slopes.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
*   **Canonical Model Preferred:** The analysis favors a standard NFW dark matter profile with an inner slope $\gamma_{\rm in}^{\rm halo} = 1.04^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$ and a Salpeter-like stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF), rejecting the need for radially varying stellar mass-to-light ratios or generalized dark matter profiles.
*   **Mass Measurements:** The study infers a stellar mass of $M_{\star} = 4.4^{+0.25}_{-0.39}\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ and a halo mass of $M_{200}^{\rm halo} = 1.11^{+0.37}_{-0.32}\times 10^{13}\,M_{\odot}$, placing the galaxy slightly ($\sim0.1$ dex) above typical stellar-halo mass relations but within intrinsic scatter.
*   **Methodological Leverage:** The double-source-plane geometry was critical for breaking the mass-sheet transformation degeneracy, allowing for precise disentanglement of the stellar and dark matter components.
*   **Broader Implications:** This work validates the "standard" model of massive elliptical galaxy formation and provides a methodological template for upcoming Euclid surveys, which are expected to discover large samples of similar double-source-plane systems.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational Paper Details:**
*   **Methodology:** The authors performed strong lens modeling on the "Jackpot" lens (J0946+1006). The model employed a two-component mass distribution:
    1.  **Stellar Component:** Modeled using a Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) of the light distribution with a free global mass-to-light ratio and an allowed radial gradient.
    2.  **Dark Matter Component:** Modeled as an elliptical generalized NFW (gNFW) halo, allowing the inner slope to vary.
    The double-source-plane geometry (two background sources at different redshifts) provides additional constraints to separate the dark and luminous mass contributions.
*   **Quick Reference Table:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Target | J0946+1006 ("Jackpot" lens) |
| Configuration | Double Source Plane Strong Lens |
| Stellar Mass ($M_\star$) | $4.4^{+0.25}_{-0.39}\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ |
| Halo Mass ($M_{200}$) | $1.11^{+0.37}_{-0.32}\times 10^{13}\,M_{\odot}$ |
| Inner Halo Slope ($\gamma_{\rm in}$) | $1.04^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$ (Consistent with NFW $\gamma=1$) |
| IMF Normalization | Salpeter-like |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
*   **Datasets:** Specific data products are not listed in the abstract, but the study utilizes imaging data of the J0946+1006 system.
*   **Tools:** No specific software repositories or databases are cited in the provided abstract.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*   **The Degeneracy Problem:** A major challenge in strong lensing is the degeneracy between the stellar mass-to-light ratio (and thus the IMF) and the dark matter halo profile; double-source-plane systems offer a unique geometric lever arm to break this degeneracy.
*   **Galaxy Structure Constraints:** Massive elliptical galaxies are critical testbeds for the "standard" formation model, which predicts specific correlations between stellar mass, halo mass, and density profiles (e.g., NFW profiles from CDM simulations).
*   **IMF Variability:** There is ongoing debate regarding whether the stellar IMF in massive ellipticals is universal (e.g., Salpeter, Chabrier) or varies radially/with mass; this paper addresses whether a radially varying $M/L$ is required by the data.

### [Constraints on dynamically-formed massive black holes in Little Red Dots from X-ray non-detections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21002)

**Authors:** M. Liempi, D. R. G. Schleicher, M. A. Latif, R. Schneider, F. Flammini Dotti, A. Escala, M. C. Vergara
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Little Red Dots (LRDs) are viable environments for collision-based massive black hole formation, and their observed X-ray silence can be explained by high obscuration, high metallicity, or sub-Eddington accretion rather than the absence of black holes.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Viability of Collision-Based Formation:** LRDs are confirmed as ideal birthplaces for massive black holes, particularly if they follow a mass-radius relation $R_{gal} \propto M_{gal}^{\alpha}$ with an exponent $\alpha > 0.55$.
- **Reconciling X-ray Non-detections:** The lack of X-ray detections (0.3–7 keV) in the sample does not rule out massive seeds; consistency is achieved through either high column densities/high metal enrichment (for high Eddington ratios) or moderate sub-Eddington accretion.
- **Evolutionary Sequence:** The results support a theoretical picture where LRDs begin as starbursts with massive, dynamically-formed seeds and inevitably evolve into AGN, implying the current non-detections are a phase of heavy obscuration or lower accretion efficiency.
- **Methodology:** The study modeled BH seed formation via runaway collisions and simulated X-ray emission, comparing these models against stacked X-ray upper limits for a subsample of LRDs at $z \sim 2$.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Theoretical (with Observational Constraints)**
- **Core Logic:** The authors test the compatibility of dynamical (collision-based) black hole seed formation with observational constraints. They calculate seed masses based on stellar density and velocity dispersion (dependent on the mass-radius relation) and model the resulting X-ray luminosity to compare against observed upper limits.
- **Modeling Approach:** The framework integrates a mass-radius power law for galaxies, stellar evolution, and accretion physics (Bondi/Eddington) to predict X-ray flux. It explores a parameter space of metallicity, column density ($N_H$), and Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$) to find conditions where massive seeds remain observationally "hidden."

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Target Class | Little Red Dots (LRDs) |
| Redshift Range | $z \sim 2$ |
| Observational Constraint | X-ray non-detections (0.3–7 keV) |
| Key Model Parameter | Mass-radius exponent $\alpha > 0.55$ |
| Formation Mechanism | Collisional runaway (dynamical) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- No specific URLs, databases, or software repositories were cited in the provided text.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **The LRD Puzzle:** Little Red Dots are massive, compact galaxies at $z \sim 2$ that challenge standard structure formation models due to the rapid assembly required for both their stellar components and central black holes.
- **X-ray Silence:** Despite being theoretically efficient environments for black hole growth, a significant fraction of LRDs lack the X-ray emission typically associated with AGN, creating a tension between expected growth and observed output.
- **Dynamical Formation:** Collision-based formation is proposed as a mechanism to produce massive seeds ($> 10^3 M_{\odot}$) rapidly in dense environments, potentially explaining high-redshift black hole mass-radius relations that differ from the local Universe.

(12 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The authors present a modular simulation framework built on the GAEA and L-Galaxies semi-analytical models to generate realistic mock catalogues for upcoming SKA HI galaxy surveys, successfully validating the predictions against local observations and ALFALFA survey data.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Validation Success:** The framework reproduces local Universe observations, specifically velocity functions and generalized Tully-Fisher relations, and matches the statistical distributions of HI-selected galaxies in the ALFALFA survey.
- **Model Consistency:** Predictions from the distinct GAEA and L-Galaxies semi-analytical models show mutual consistency for HI observables, suggesting robustness in the modeling approach despite different underlying physical prescriptions.
- **Methodology:** The study constructs mock catalogues that forward-model critical observational features, including selection functions, inclination effects, and redshift broadening.
- **Forecasting:** The paper provides redshift distribution forecasts for future SKA Observatory HI galaxy surveys, offering a necessary tool for cosmological probe analysis.
- **Note on Specifics:** The abstract does not provide specific numerical values for redshift distributions or mass ranges; these details are likely in the full text.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Simulation-based**

- **Simulations used:** The framework utilizes merger trees from the **Millennium Simulation suite** as the gravitational backbone.
- **Models used:** It employs two independent semi-analytical models (SAMs) as bases: **GAEA** (Galaxy Evolution and Assembly) and **L-Galaxies**.
- **Physical properties studied:** Neutral Hydrogen (HI) content, 21cm emission line properties, and galaxy rotational velocities.
- **Reproduction of observations:** The framework validates against local Universe data (velocity functions, Tully-Fisher relations) and reproduces the statistical properties of the ALFALFA survey by incorporating selection functions and observational effects (inclination, redshift broadening).
- **Key simulation references:** Millennium Simulation, GAEA model, L-Galaxies model.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **Datasets:**
    - ALFALFA (Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA) survey data (used for validation).
    - Millennium Simulation suite (merger trees).
- **Tools/Software:**
    - GAEA Semi-Analytical Model.
    - L-Galaxies Semi-Analytical Model.
    - *Note: No specific URLs or GitHub repositories are listed in the provided abstract.*

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **Scientific Imperative:** The scientific return of upcoming SKA Observatory galaxy surveys depends critically on the availability of predictive models for HI observables to interpret unprecedented detection volumes.
- **Modeling Gap:** There is a need for frameworks that bridge the gap between theoretical galaxy formation models and observable survey data by forward-modeling selection functions and instrumental effects.
- **Cosmological Context:** The 21cm emission line serves as a key probe for both galaxy evolution and cosmology, necessitating simulations that can accurately predict redshift distributions and HI scaling relations.

**Authors:** Wuji Wang, Andreas L. Faisst, Kyle Finner, Livia Vallini, Andrea Pallottini, Enrico Veraldi, Bahram Mobasher, Yu-Heng Lin, et al. (40 total)
**Relevance Score:** 7.5/10

• This study investigates the variation in chemical composition between the interstellar medium (ISM) and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in massive main-sequence galaxies at redshifts $z=4-6$.

• The authors utilize JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy and ALMA observations to derive and compare optical line ratios and metallicity tracers from the inner galaxy regions ($<3$ kpc) to the outer halo ($5-10$ kpc).

• The analysis reveals that the CGM is enriched to a similar chemical abundance level as the ISM, though marginal differences in line ratios suggest higher ionization in the ISM and a nitrogen deficit in the CGM.

• These findings indicate efficient metal mixing driven by feedback or mergers in the early universe, providing new constraints on how metals are redistributed from the interior of galaxies to their halos.

### [Detectability of Satellite Planes in Mock Observations of Isolated L* Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20447)

**Authors:** Ethan Crosby, Marcel S. Pawlowski, Oliver M\"uller, Helmut Jerjen
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

*   **Problem:** The prevalence of planar, co-rotating satellite distributions around L* galaxies remains uncertain due to a lack of statistically robust samples, necessitating better constraints for future observations.
*   **Method:** The authors generated mock observations of isolated L* galaxies using the Illustris TNG100-1 simulation, systematically varying satellite numbers, plane membership, and viewing orientations to test detection metrics.
*   **Result:** Detection success is highly dependent on viewing angle and satellite count; planes are most easily detected when viewed edge-on or face-on, and generally require systems with more than 20 satellites for reliable identification.
*   **Significance:** These findings provide a practical framework for prioritizing targets and designing surveys to successfully detect and characterize satellite planes.

### [Formation of first star clusters under the supersonic gas flow -- III. Environmental trends and halo-to-halo scatter in the Pop III IMF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20690)

**Authors:** Shingo Hirano, Yusuke Sakai, Hideyuki Umeda
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

*   **Question:** This study challenges the common assumption that Population III stars follow a single universal initial mass function (IMF) across different minihaloes.
*   **Method:** The authors utilize 138 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamics simulations to map stellar masses based on gas accretion rates across varying redshifts, halo masses, and baryon-dark matter streaming velocities (SV).
*   **Result:** The findings rule out a universal IMF, demonstrating that massive, high-SV haloes preferentially form rich clusters with very massive stars ($\gtrsim 10^3$–$10^4 M_\odot$), whereas low-mass, low-SV haloes produce only one or a few stars.
*   **Significance:** This provides a physically motivated prescription for per-halo IMFs, linking specific environments to the formation of heavy black hole seeds and the chemical enrichment signatures of metal-poor stars.

### [Willman 1 Revisited: The Kinematics, Chemistry, and Orbital Properties of a Potentially-Disrupting Dwarf Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20272)

**Authors:** Camille Chiu, Marla Geha, William Cerny, Nitya Kallivayalil, Hannah Richstein, Christopher T. Garling, Beth Willman
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

*   This study investigates the ambiguous nature of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellite Willman 1 to determine whether it is a dwarf galaxy or a star cluster.
*   The authors analyze new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy and HST/ACS photometry to identify 57 member stars and model the system's orbital history.
*   The system exhibits a velocity dispersion of 4.7 km s$^{-1}$, a significant metallicity spread, and no mass segregation, confirming its classification as a galaxy.
*   However, orbital analysis suggests Willman 1 is likely undergoing tidal disruption, cautioning that measured kinematics may not accurately reflect its true dynamical mass.

### [An automated activity classification tool for optical galaxy spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20343)

**Authors:** C. Daoutis, A. Zezas, E. Kyritsis, K. Kouroumpatzakis, P. Bonfini
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

*   **Problem:** Traditional galaxy classification methods are often biased by the extensive preprocessing required, such as starlight subtraction and emission line deblending.
*   **Method:** The authors developed an automated Support Vector Machine tool that uses equivalent widths of specific emission lines (H$\beta$, [O III], H$\alpha$+[N II]) to classify galaxies without the need for spectral fitting or flux calibration.
*   **Results:** The diagnostic achieves an overall accuracy of 83% and high recall rates across five galaxy classes, distinguishing between star-forming, AGN, LINER, composite, and passive galaxies.
*   **Significance:** This approach simplifies the classification process, eliminates biases from preprocessing, and is applicable to high-redshift studies due to its narrow wavelength requirements.

*   **Methodology:** The authors combine spatially resolved star formation histories derived from UV-IR data with Bayesian X-ray spectral fitting of *Chandra* observations across five regions selected by star formation rate density.
*   **Key Result:** The hot gas emission is consistent with the thermalization of 40–50% of core-collapse supernova energy, with temperature and X-ray production efficiency scaling as $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.34}$.
*   **Significance:** The findings suggest that mass-loading of supernova ejecta decreases with star formation rate density and that the hot ISM is over-pressurized relative to the large-scale dynamical equilibrium, driving expansion into the ambient medium.

### [Galaxy evolution in the cosmic web: the relative impact of nodes and filaments in the EAGLE simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20733)

**Authors:** Suman Sarkar, Biswajit Pandey, Apashanka Das
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

This study investigates the distinct and joint roles of cosmic web nodes and filaments in driving galaxy evolution. Using the EAGLE simulation and DisPerSE structure finder, the authors analyze galaxy colour distributions and employ an information-theoretic approach to quantify environmental influences. The analysis reveals that red galaxies preferentially reside near nodes and filament cores while blue galaxies dominate the outskirts, identifying characteristic transition scales at $\sim 2.5$ Mpc for nodes and $\sim 0.75$ Mpc for filaments. These findings support a scale-dependent view of galaxy evolution where nodes and filaments exert distinct, complementary influences, particularly on low-mass systems.

### [Dynamical friction on binary stars in dark matter dominated environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20245)

**Authors:** Nicolas Esser
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

This study investigates how dynamical friction affects binary stars moving through a uniform dark matter background. The author derives analytical formulas for the secular evolution of orbital parameters, explicitly accounting for the center-of-mass motion of the stellar pairs. Applied to environments typical of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, the results show that binaries undergo significant eccentricity oscillations and gradual orbital decay, which can enhance velocity dispersion biases in unresolved populations. These findings suggest binary stars could serve as a novel tool to probe the dark matter content of the faintest galaxies.

### [BASS LVI. Connecting X-ray variability with AGN physical properties and a new path to Cosmological distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20315)

**Authors:** Matilde Signorini, Federica Ricci, Alessia Tortosa, Stefano Bianchi, Fabio La Franca, Franz E. Bauer, Fiona A. Harrison, Kohei Ichikawa, et al. (21 total)
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

*   This study investigates whether X-ray variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can serve as a reliable standard candle for cosmology, addressing the large intrinsic dispersion in known variability relations.
*   The authors analyze a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS)—the largest sample used for this purpose to date—to test correlations between variability, black hole mass, and luminosity.
*   Contrary to earlier findings, variability correlates with luminosity as strongly as with black hole mass; however, the scatter in the luminosity-variability relation remains high (~0.63 dex), preventing competitive distance estimates compared to Type Ia supernovae.
*   While current limitations preclude immediate use as a standard candle, future X-ray missions like NewAthena could refine this method for thousands of AGN up to redshift $z\sim3$.

### [Chandra X-ray Observations of Quasars with Velocity-Offset Broad Lines: Assessing the Binary Supermassive Black Hole Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20438)

**Authors:** Peter Breiding, Michael Eracleous, Tamara Bogdanovi\'c, Sarah Burke-Spolaor, T. Joseph W. Lazio
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

*   **Main Question:** This study investigates whether quasars with velocity-offset broad emission lines are signatures of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) as opposed to recoiling SMBHs or gas dynamical effects.
*   **Method:** The authors analyzed *Chandra* X-ray observations of 16 nearby quasars to constrain black hole masses using multiple independent techniques and compared their X-ray spectral properties to the general quasar population.
*   **Key Result:** The quasars exhibit systematically harder X-ray photon indices than typical and show significant discrepancies between mass estimation methods, but the data do not provide conclusive evidence for or against the binary SMBH hypothesis.
*   **Significance:** These findings offer critical constraints for distinguishing between competing physical models regarding the origin of kinematically offset broad line regions.

### [A multi-wavelength study of nearby starburst galaxy M 82](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20786)

**Authors:** Nilkanth Vagshette, Satish S. Sonkamble, Madhav Patil, Sachindra Naik, Ilani Loubser
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

This study investigates the star formation history, metal enrichment, and outflow dynamics in the nearby starburst galaxy M 82. The authors combine high-resolution Far-ultraviolet imaging from AstroSat with archival Chandra X-ray data to perform a multi-wavelength analysis. They find a significant discrepancy between infrared (16–18 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and ultraviolet (0.022 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) star formation rates, revealing that most star formation is heavily dust-obscured, while X-ray spectra show enhanced metals tracing supernova-driven outflows. These results highlight the critical need for multi-wavelength data to accurately assess star formation and feedback in starburst environments.

### [Scattering, Migration, Re-circularization and Relaxation to Build Out Galaxy Disks with Exponential Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21171)

**Authors:** Curtis Struck, Bruce G. Elmegreen, Elena DOnghia
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

• **Background:** This study investigates how scattering of stars by interstellar clouds influences stellar velocity dispersion and contributes to the formation of exponential radial profiles in galaxy disks.

• **Method:** The authors employ calculations in a simplified disk model that excludes complicating factors like spiral waves and star formation to isolate the effects of cloud-star scattering.

• **Result:** Scattering reaches a steady-state eccentricity distribution where stellar orbits are recircularized at the same rate they are excited, effectively regulating disk heating and maintaining kinematic coherence regardless of cloud mass.

• **Significance:** This process provides a physical mechanism for creating and sustaining exponential stellar disks across galaxy types, while also identifying a bifurcation that may explain the properties of early-type disks.
