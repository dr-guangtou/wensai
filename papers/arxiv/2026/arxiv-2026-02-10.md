### [Gravitational Wave Informed Inference of 21-cm Global Signal Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07631)

**Authors:** Avinash Tiwari, Sajad A. Bhat, Tirthankar Roy Choudhury, Susmita Adhikari, Mukesh Kumar Singh, Shasvath J. Kapadia
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

The paper "Gravitational Wave Informed Inference of 21-cm Global Signal Parameters" by Avinash Tiwari et al. addresses the challenge of understanding the formation of the first stars and galaxies during the transition from the Dark Ages to the Cosmic Dawn, a period that is currently observationally unconstrained. The authors propose a novel multi-messenger framework that leverages observations of binary black hole (BBH) mergers from next-generation gravitational wave detectors like Cosmic Explorer to improve the inference of parameters related to the 21-cm cosmic hydrogen signal. This approach helps break degeneracies in the parameters that describe the early Universe's thermal and ionization history. The key finding is that the merger rate of BBHs, which depends on the star formation rate density at high redshifts (around 13-25), can serve as an effective tracer to enhance our understanding of the cosmic dawn. This methodological innovation is significant because it combines gravitational wave astronomy with radio astronomy to provide new insights into the early Universe's evolution.

### [Complementary Roles of Distance and Growth Probes in Testing Time-Varying Dark Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08207)

**Authors:** Seokcheon Lee
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

The paper "Complementary Roles of Distance and Growth Probes in Testing Time-Varying Dark Energy" by Seokcheon Lee investigates how distance and growth measurements can complement each other in probing the time-dependent features of dark energy. Lee employs an information-based approach, analyzing the eigenvalue structure of the Fisher information matrix constructed from distance, expansion rate, and growth observables. The study finds that distance and expansion-rate data typically produce a strongly hierarchical Fisher spectrum dominated by a single information mode, limiting sensitivity to temporal variations in dark energy. In contrast, growth measurements, which respond through differential dynamics, can introduce additional independent information directions. This work clarifies the complementary roles of these probes and provides a model-independent criterion for assessing the physical content of cosmological constraints on dynamical dark energy, which is crucial for understanding the nature of dark energy and the expansion history of the Universe.

They argue that these PBHs can be more abundant than those predicted by standard models due to gravitational collapse of significant overdensities in the radiation phase. The authors also predict a broad spectrum for curvature perturbations and a flat stochastic gravitational wave background at a level of \(\Omega_\text{GW} h^2 \simeq 10^{-10}\) up to the mHz range. This work matters because it offers a novel perspective on the origin of dark matter, linking it to fundamental aspects of cosmological inflation and potentially providing observable signatures through gravitational waves.

### [Kosmulator: A Python framework for cosmological inference with MCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08424)

**Authors:** Renier T. Hough, Robert Rugg, Shambel Sahlu, Amare Abebe
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

The paper introduces Kosmulator, a Python framework aimed at accelerating the statistical testing of cosmological models, addressing the computational bottleneck associated with implementing new expansion histories in traditional Einstein--Boltzmann solvers. The framework leverages array-native execution and efficient ensemble slice sampling to perform rapid Bayesian inference. Validated against the industry-standard Cobaya code using Type Ia Supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, Kosmulator achieves a significant reduction in computational time, with a 4.5 times faster wall-clock time on a single CPU core compared to a standard MPI-parallelised baseline, while maintaining high precision in posterior constraints and chi-square values. This advancement allows researchers to quickly filter theoretical candidates, enhancing the efficiency of hypothesis testing in cosmology.

The paper "Stratification of the AGN-Driven multi-phase outflows in the dwarf Seyfert galaxy NGC 4395" by Payel Nandi et al. investigates the structure and dynamics of outflows driven by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the dwarf Seyfert galaxy NGC 4395, which hosts an intermediate-mass black hole. The authors employ a multi-wavelength approach, combining data from JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI IFU spectroscopy, ALMA, and Gemini/GMOS to probe ionised and molecular gas on parsec scales. They identify outflow signatures in various gas phases, with ionised outflow velocities ranging from 127 to 716 km/s and a stratified biconical geometry. The study finds that the cold molecular gas has a significantly higher mass outflow rate compared to warmer phases, and that only low-ionisation gas significantly impacts the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This research provides crucial insights into the kinetic coupling efficiency and stratification of AGN-driven outflows, highlighting the role of different gas phases in shaping the ISM and galaxy evolution.

### [Scavenger hunt: Selection of obscured active galactic nuclei combining multiband optical variability and colors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07109)

**Authors:** Demetra De Cicco, Stefano Cavuoti, Maurizio Paolillo, Vincenzo Petrecca, Ylenia Maruccia, Paula S\'anchez-S\'aez
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper "Scavenger hunt: Selection of obscured active galactic nuclei combining multiband optical variability and colors" by De Cicco et al. addresses the challenge of identifying obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) using a combination of optical variability and color selection. The authors employ a random forest classifier trained on features from g+r+i band light curves from the VST-COSMOS survey, along with optical/infrared colors and a morphology indicator, to identify AGN candidates. They find that combining variability features with colors significantly improves the identification of obscured AGN, achieving a recovery rate of $69^{+10}_{-8}\%$ of known obscured AGN when confirmed in two out of three bands. This method is crucial for enhancing selection purity and reliability, especially in the context of upcoming wide-field surveys like the LSST, which will produce vast amounts of data.

### [Exploring the dynamical evolution of binary stars in multiple-population globular clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07119)

**Authors:** J. Bruce, E. Vesperini, A. Askar, E. Bortolan, M. Giersz, J. Hong, A. Hypki, A. P. Milone
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper titled "Exploring the dynamical evolution of binary stars in multiple-population globular clusters" by J. Bruce et al. investigates how the presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters affects the evolution of binary stars. The authors utilized Monte Carlo simulations with the MOCCA code to model the long-term dynamical behavior of binary stars in clusters with two distinct populations. They found that binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience higher rates of hardening and disruption compared to the first population (P1), resulting in distinct radial profiles for binary incidence and fraction. Additionally, they discovered that mixed binaries (comprising components from both populations) primarily form through dynamical interactions in the core. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between cluster dynamics and binary star evolution, suggesting that binaries can serve as valuable tracers of a cluster's initial conditions and its dynamical history.

### [Massive Star Population in the Sextans A Dwarf Galaxy from HST UV Photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07177)

**Authors:** Roberto Flores, Elena Fantino, Giuseppina Battaglia, Antonio Aparicio
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper titled "Massive Star Population in the Sextans A Dwarf Galaxy from HST UV Photometry" by Roberto Flores, Elena Fantino, Giuseppina Battaglia, and Antonio Aparicio investigates the properties of massive main sequence stars in the metal-poor dwarf irregular galaxy Sextans A using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV photometry. The authors construct a catalog of 655 massive stars (M > 8 M$_\odot$) by arranging the photometric data in a Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) and overlaying it with stellar evolutionary tracks from the MIST library. They employ a Finite Element (FE) interpolation method to derive the stars' properties, including mass and age, and compute the uncertainties efficiently. The most massive star in their catalog is estimated at $58\pm11~$M$_\odot$. This study provides a comprehensive list of candidates for follow-up spectroscopic observations, which could enhance our understanding of the early evolutionary stages of massive low-metallicity stars.

### [A General Formulation of the Kinematic Dipole as a Functional of Selection and Source Properties: Beyond the Ellis--Baldwin Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07389)

**Authors:** Tsutomu T. Takeuchi (Nagoya University)
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper by Tsutomu T. Takeuchi addresses the limitations of the traditional Ellis & Baldwin expression for the kinematic dipole anisotropy in galaxy and QSO number counts, which assumes idealized conditions like power-law number counts and single power-law spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Takeuchi develops a unified formulation of the kinematic dipole that incorporates realistic survey effects such as diverse SEDs, finite instrumental bandpasses, and non-power-law number counts. The key finding is that the dipole amplitude is not described by a single index but by a functional, \(\mathcal{A}[\mathcal{W},f]\), representing the Doppler response of the selection function on the underlying population. This general formulation recovers the classical Ellis--Baldwin result as a special case and provides a robust framework for interpreting discrepancies in kinematic dipole measurements across different surveys, making it particularly relevant for future wide-area, multi-band observations.

### [Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes from a Localized Bump or Dip Feature in a Single-Field Inflationary Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07951)

**Authors:** Xiang Zhang, Zhao-Huan Yu
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper explores how localized features in a single-field inflationary potential, specifically bumps or dips, can influence the production of scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes. The authors introduce these features to temporarily decelerate the inflaton, resulting in a sharp peak in the primordial curvature power spectrum. This enhancement significantly boosts the stochastic background of gravitational waves and increases the formation of primordial black holes. Through eight benchmark cases, they demonstrate that the predicted abundances of primordial black holes align with current observational constraints, while the gravitational wave spectra, peaking across a wide frequency range, are detectable by future experiments. This research matters because it provides a viable mechanism for generating both gravitational waves and primordial black holes within the framework of single-field inflation, offering new avenues for testing inflationary models and understanding the early universe.

### [Modeling Tidal Disruption Events and Compact Object Plunges in Nuclear Star Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08574)

**Authors:** Philip Cho, Kai Wu, Francesco Flammini Dotti, Taras Panamarev, Rainer Spurzem
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper "Modeling Tidal Disruption Events and Compact Object Plunges in Nuclear Star Clusters" by Philip Cho et al. investigates how tidal disruption events (TDEs) and compact object inspirals contribute to the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). The authors use the STARDISK version of the direct N-body code NBODY6++GPU to conduct pilot simulations with enhanced models for mass fallback from TDEs and orbital decay timescales for compact object plunges. They find that mass accretion from TDEs peaks within the first 2 million years and decreases more rapidly for higher initial SMBH masses, with approximately half of the disrupted stellar debris being accreted. Compact object accretion is primarily confined to orbits with pericenters between 4 and 27 Schwarzschild radii and is significantly suppressed when inspiral criteria are applied. This research is crucial for understanding the mechanisms that drive SMBH growth in dense stellar environments.

### [Hints of sign-changing scalar field energy density and a transient acceleration phase at $z\sim 2$ from model-agnostic reconstructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08928)

**Authors:** \"Ozg\"ur Akarsu, Maria Caruana, Konstantinos F. Dialektopoulos, Luis A. Escamilla, Emre O. Kahya, Jackson Levi Said
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

The paper titled "Hints of sign-changing scalar field energy density and a transient acceleration phase at \( z \sim 2 \) from model-agnostic reconstructions" by Akarsu et al. investigates the late-time expansion history of the universe and its implications for dark energy dynamics. The authors employ a data-driven approach using a node-based Gaussian-process-kernel interpolant to reconstruct the reduced Hubble rate, leveraging data from cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+ supernovae, BAO measurements, and external \( H_0 \) priors. They find that the inferred dark energy density changes sign, transitioning from negative at higher redshifts to positive near the present, suggesting a transition redshift \( z_\dagger \). This behavior is consistent with a phantom field or a two-field quintom framework, indicating a possible additional accelerated-expansion interval around \( z \sim 1.7 \)–\( 2.3 \). The study highlights the potential for transient acceleration phases and the need for more complex dark energy models to explain the observed cosmic expansion history.
