**Relevance Score:** 10.0/10

### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The study reveals that the traditional notion of 'downsizing' does not extend to dwarf galaxies, with the fraction of quenched galaxies showing a 'U' shape as a function of stellar mass, driven by internal processes rather than external environmental factors.

### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- The fraction of red (quenched) galaxies in the dwarf regime (10^7 MSun < Mstar < 10^9.5 MSun) decreases until Mstar ~ 10^8.5 MSun and then increases again towards lower stellar masses.
- The study used a mass-complete sample of ~5900 dwarf galaxies at z < 0.15, constructed from deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field.
- The 'U' shape persists regardless of environment, indicating that internal processes rather than external environmental factors drive the quenching of star formation.
- The results suggest that supernova feedback dominates quenching at Mstar < 10^8 MSun, while AGN feedback becomes significant at Mstar > 10^9 MSun, with the least effective quenching occurring in the range 10^8 MSun < Mstar < 10^9 MSun.

### [Black Hole Feedback, Galaxy Quenching and Outflows at Cosmic Dawn: Analysis of the SEEDZ Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09104)

**Authors:** Lewis R. Prole, John A. Regan, Daxal Mehta, R\"udiger Pakmor, Sophie Koudmani, Martin A. Bourne, Simon C. O. Glover, John H. Wise, et al. (16 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.8/10

### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The SEEDZ simulations reveal that massive black holes (MBHs) in the early universe can grow to $\sim10^6$ M$_\odot$ by $z=12.5$ through super-Eddington accretion, but feedback from the MBHs themselves, rather than supernovae or gas exhaustion, halts this growth and can completely evacuate gas from the host halo, challenging current assumptions about MBH feedback strength and galaxy formation processes.

### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- The most massive black holes in the SEEDZ simulations grow to $\sim10^6$ M$_\odot$ by $z=12.5$ through short bursts of super-Eddington accretion lasting 5-30 Myr.
- The primary factor halting this initial growth is feedback from the MBHs themselves, not supernovae or gas exhaustion.
- Feedback from the most actively accreting MBHs completely evacuates gas from the host halo and ejects it into the inter-galactic medium, despite a relatively weak feedback model being implemented.
- The maximum MBH masses are effectively set by a combination of MBH feedback modeling and the binding potential of the host halo, suggesting that unless feedback is extremely ineffective, MBHs at $z>12.5$ should not significantly exceed $10^6$ M$_\odot$.

### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Simulation-based:**
- **Simulations used:** SEEDZ simulations, which model the growth and feedback effects of massive black holes in the early universe.
- **Physical properties studied:** Growth rates of MBHs, feedback mechanisms, gas evacuation from host halos, and the impact on galaxy formation.
- **Reproduction of observations:** The simulations suggest that some high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST may have formed via a two-step process involving initial quenching by MBH feedback and later reconstitution of baryonic reservoirs.
- **Key simulation references:** Not explicitly provided in the abstract, but likely includes foundational works on black hole feedback and early universe simulations.

- No specific URLs to databases or datasets mentioned.
- No specific software/GitHub repos referenced.

### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- The SEEDZ simulations aim to provide insights into how MBHs grow and affect their host galaxies during the cosmic dawn, addressing the interplay between black hole accretion, feedback, and galaxy quenching.
- The study explores the implications of MBH feedback on the maximum mass of black holes at high redshifts and the potential for a two-step galaxy formation process involving MBH-induced quenching and subsequent reconstitution of baryonic reservoirs.

**Authors:** Viacheslav V. Klimenko, Varsha P. Kulkarni, Monique C. Aller
**Relevance Score:** 7.7/10

The paper "Probing Dust Composition in Distant Galaxies with JWST Mid-IR Spectroscopy of Quasars with Foreground 2175 A Absorbers I: Methodology" by Viacheslav V. Klimenko, Varsha P. Kulkarni, and Monique C. Aller investigates the composition and structure of interstellar dust in distant galaxies using JWST MIRI MRS observations. The authors focus on gas-rich and dusty galaxies at redshifts \( z < 1.2 \) with strong 2175 Å absorption bumps along the lines of sight to background quasars. They describe their observational strategy and present initial results from five quasar spectra, identifying artifacts in the MIRI MRS data and proposing methods to mitigate their effects. The study finds significant absorption from the 10 μm silicate feature in all five quasar spectra, with differences in peak position, width, and profile asymmetry compared to the Milky Way's diffuse ISM. This research is crucial for understanding the role of dust in galaxy evolution, as dust influences gas cooling and molecule formation.

### [Analysis of Galactic cirrus filaments in HSC-SSP high-resolution deep images using artificial neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09779)

**Authors:** Denis M. Poliakov, Anton A. Smirnov, Sergey S. Savchenko, Alexander A. Marchuk, Aleksandr V. Mosenkov, Vladimir B. Ilin, George A. Gontcharov, Daria G. Turichina, et al. (9 total)
**Relevance Score:** 7.5/10

The paper "Analysis of Galactic cirrus filaments in HSC-SSP high-resolution deep images using artificial neural networks" by Denis M. Poliakov et al. addresses the challenge of identifying and characterizing Galactic optical cirrus filaments, which can obscure faint objects and dim extragalactic structures. The authors employ convolutional neural networks and ensemble learning to analyze high-resolution images from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) in the $g$, $r$, and $i$ wavebands. They find that their method detects 4.5 times more cirrus clouds compared to previous studies using SDSS Stripe 82 data, revealing that the sky background in HSC-SSP coadd images is over-subtracted, which can significantly affect the brightness of nearby objects. This over-subtraction can dim objects with surface brightness of $m = 29~\mbox{mag~arcsec}^{-2}$ by up to 0.5 magnitudes in the $r$ band, highlighting the need to account for cirrus clouds in sky background estimation algorithms.

### [Non-minimally Coupled Running Curvaton: A Unified Approach to Early-Universe Inflation and Phantom Dark Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09705)

**Authors:** Bichu Li, Lei-Hua Liu
**Relevance Score:** 7.1/10

The paper titled "Non-minimally Coupled Running Curvaton: A Unified Approach to Early-Universe Inflation and Phantom Dark Energy" by Bichu Li and Lei-Hua Liu addresses the challenge posed by recent observations indicating a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w < -1$), which contradicts the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The authors propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model with a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $\xi \chi^2 R$. This modification allows the effective equation of state to evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime, providing a better fit to the latest observational data while preserving the model's success in describing early-universe inflation. The introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's stability or its predictions for the primordial power spectrum and non-Gaussianity, ensuring consistency with Planck data. This unified approach offers a robust and stable description of both inflation and late-time accelerated expansion, compatible with precision cosmology data.

**Relevance Score:** 6.9/10

The paper investigates the origin of radio emission in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5938 (Araish), aiming to distinguish between contributions from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and star formation. The authors utilize multi-wavelength observations, including data from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, DECaPS2, WISE, and eROSITA, to analyze the galaxy's emission. They detect extended radio emission with a steep non-thermal spectral index ($\alpha = -1.2 \pm 0.2$), indicative of synchrotron radiation from an AGN jet extending approximately 8.2 kpc. The study also reveals that the radio jet is confined by a larger X-ray gas halo, suggesting jet collimation and channelling effects. This finding highlights the complex interplay between AGN activity and star formation in NGC 5938 and provides insights into the physical processes governing these phenomena in spiral galaxies.

### [Are carbon deflagration supernovae triggered by dark matter ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09274)

**Authors:** Jeremy Mould
**Relevance Score:** 6.8/10

The paper by Jeremy Mould investigates whether carbon deflagration supernovae, a type of Type Ia supernovae, could be triggered by collisions between white dwarfs and dark matter in the Galactic bulge. Mould examines the kinetic energy transfer from primordial black holes to white dwarfs, noting that even a lunar mass black hole could significantly raise the core temperature of a white dwarf, potentially initiating a supernova. While current observational data are inconclusive about the spatial distribution of these supernovae, future surveys from the Rubin telescope, expected to capture millions of supernovae, will provide clearer insights. This research is significant because it explores a novel mechanism for supernova triggering and could impact our understanding of both dark matter interactions and the spatial distribution of supernovae in galaxies.

### [Stellar-mass black holes in young massive and open stellar clusters -- VII. Comparisons with gravitational-wave events until LVK-O4a and Gaia compact binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09694)

**Authors:** Sambaran Banerjee
**Relevance Score:** 6.8/10

The paper by Sambaran Banerjee investigates the contribution of young massive clusters (YMC) evolving into old open clusters (OC) to the population of gravitational-wave (GW) compact binary mergers detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observatories. The study employs a grid of 90 N-body evolutionary models of star clusters, varying in initial mass, radius, and metallicity, and includes detailed physics such as primordial binaries, BH and NS formation, spin prescriptions, and GW recoil kicks. The key finding is that dynamically assembled binary black holes (BBH) from these clusters can account for 25%-33% of the observed GW merger rate, with a non-monotonic efficiency peaking at specific cluster masses. This research highlights the importance of the YMC/OC channel in understanding the observed GW events and suggests that other formation channels are also necessary to fully explain the data.

### [A Monopolar Jet from Protostar HOPS 10: Evidence for Asymmetric Magnetized Launching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09404)

**Authors:** Somnath Dutta
**Relevance Score:** 6.2/10

The paper investigates the mechanism by which protostellar jets, crucial for removing excess angular momentum during star formation, are launched and extract angular momentum. Using high-resolution ALMA observations at 345 GHz and 230 GHz, the study examines CO and SiO emissions from the protostar HOPS 10, revealing a uniquely monopolar jet with velocity offsets of +44 to +66 km/s on one side, unlike typical bipolar jets. This monopolarity is consistent across all tracers and cannot be explained by cloud contamination or obscuration, suggesting asymmetric mass loading along the disk's magnetic field lines as the most plausible explanation. This finding challenges existing models of jet formation and highlights the need for a better understanding of the asymmetric processes involved in protostellar jet launching.

### [A deep MeerKAT view of associated HI absorption in radio AGNs at intermediate redshift: Role of absorber geometry and conditions of the gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09478)

**Authors:** Raffaella Morganti, Tom Oosterloo, Clive Tadhunter, Suma Murthy
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

The paper by Morganti et al. investigates the presence of HI absorption in a sample of 17 powerful radio sources at intermediate redshifts ($0.25<z<0.7$) using deep MeerKAT observations. The authors aim to understand how the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their host galaxies influence the detection of HI absorption. They achieved extremely low optical depths in their spectra, resulting in three new HI absorption detections, with two being associated absorptions in young radio sources. The findings suggest that the detection rate of HI absorption is influenced by a combination of the evolutionary status of the radio sources, physical conditions, and the geometry of the gas structure, highlighting the complex interplay between AGN activity and the surrounding gas.

### [NIAC project report: Solar system-scale VLBI to dramatically improve cosmological distance measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09141)

**Authors:** Matthew McQuinn, Miguel Morales, Casey McGrath, Alyssa Alvarez, Katelyn Glasby, T. Joseph W. Lazio, Kiyoshi Masui, Lyujia Pan, et al. (10 total)
**Relevance Score:** 6.0/10

The paper explores the feasibility of the Cosmic Positioning System (CPS), a proposed space mission that aims to make purely geometric distance measurements to sources hundreds of megaparsecs away by detecting electromagnetic wavefront curvature using a constellation of radio antennas distributed across the outer Solar System. The key methodology involves precisely timing the arrival of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) to infer source distances via trilateration, similar to GPS but on cosmological scales. The study finds that CPS could achieve sub-percent constraints on the Hubble constant with just a few FRB detections, and it evaluates and finds manageable the dominant sources of uncertainty, such as wavefront timing precision and interstellar refractive delays. This approach could significantly improve our understanding of cosmic expansion and enable new measurements in astrophysics and fundamental physics, including insights into dark matter structure and gravitational waves.

### [Microlensing events and primordial black holes in the axionlike curvaton model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09558)

**Authors:** Kentaro Kasai, Masahiro Kawasaki, Kai Murai, Shunsuke Neda
**Relevance Score:** 5.8/10

The paper explores whether microlensing events observed by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) could be explained by primordial black holes (PBHs) within the axionlike curvaton model. The authors investigate two types of this model, which predict an enhancement of curvature perturbations on small scales, potentially leading to the formation of PBHs. They find that PBHs with masses of \(10^{-7}\)-\(10^{-6} M_\odot\) could account for the observed microlensing events and constitute a significant fraction (\(\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})\)) of dark matter. This work is significant as it provides a potential explanation for the observed microlensing events and has broader cosmological implications, including the production of gravitational waves.

**Relevance Score:** 5.7/10

The paper titled "Measurement of the Full Shape of the Thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich Power Spectrum from South Pole Telescope and {\it Herschel}-SPIRE Observations" by S. Raghunathan et al. addresses the challenge of accurately measuring the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect, a distortion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) caused by hot gas in galaxy clusters. The authors combine data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the {\it Herschel}-SPIRE survey across multiple frequency bands to create detailed tSZ maps. They use linear combination techniques to produce minimum-variance and foreground-minimized maps, and measure the tSZ power spectrum down to arcminute scales. The key finding is a 9.3σ detection of the tSZ power spectrum, with evidence for a scale-dependent correlation between the tSZ effect and the cosmic infrared background (CIB). This result provides the deepest tSZ maps to date and offers new constraints on astrophysical feedback mechanisms and models of the intracluster medium, advancing our understanding of galaxy cluster physics.

### [Constraining long-lived dark sector particles with CMB and Lyman-$\alpha$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10078)

**Authors:** Laura Lopez-Honorez, Sonali Verma
**Relevance Score:** 5.6/10

Laura Lopez-Honorez and Sonali Verma's preprint titled "Constraining long-lived dark sector particles with CMB and Lyman-$\alpha$" addresses the question of how long-lived dark sector particles, with lifetimes exceeding $10^{16}$ seconds, influence the intergalactic medium (IGM) through their decays into Standard Model states. The authors employ measurements of the IGM temperature derived from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest to set new constraints on these dark sector models, demonstrating that late-time IGM heating provides a complementary perspective to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in probing cosmologically long-lived hidden sectors. Their analysis updates constraints from Planck's measurements of the optical depth to reionization and highlights that these results can be broadly applied to various decaying hidden-sector scenarios, such as evaporating primordial black holes and dark photons coupled to the Standard Model. This work is significant as it offers a novel approach to understanding the interactions between dark sector particles and the visible universe, potentially shedding light on the nature of dark matter and its impact on cosmic evolution.

### [Unraveling the mysteries of Jets in peculiar NLSy1 galaxies through multi-wavelength variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09171)

**Authors:** Vineet Ojha, Xue-Bing Wu, Luis C. Ho, Raj Prince, Joysankar Majumdar, Hum Chand, Chi-Zhuo Wang
**Relevance Score:** 5.5/10

The paper "Unraveling the mysteries of Jets in peculiar NLSy1 galaxies through multi-wavelength variability" by Vineet Ojha et al. investigates the origin of flux variations in radio-quiet narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (RQ-NLSy1s), which are typically dominated by thermal emission from accretion disks but have shown non-thermal radio flares. The authors conducted a systematic study combining optical and mid-infrared (MIR) variability data with broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. They used high-cadence optical light curves from ZTF and long-term MIR light curves from WISE to quantify variability across different timescales. The key findings include statistically significant long-term optical variability with increasing amplitudes toward shorter wavelengths, bluer-when-brighter trends in three sources, and intrinsic MIR variability in three of four sources. These results, supported by SED modeling, suggest that a subset of RQ-NLSy1s hosts weak or intermittent jets contributing to their optical and MIR emission, highlighting the need for coordinated multi-wavelength monitoring to better understand these phenomena.

The calibration involves using linear variable filters and monochromatic wavelength scans to derive spectral response functions, band centers, and resolving powers for each pixel. Key findings include band centers measured to better than 1nm for wavelengths up to 3.82um and better than 10nm for longer wavelengths, with resolving power measured to within 5% and aligning with design expectations. This calibration is crucial for accurately interpreting SPHEREx data, ensuring reliable measurements of astrophysical phenomena, and supporting community use of the mission's data.

### [Highly suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio from a modified Lennard-Jones inflationary potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09599)

**Authors:** Panagiotis G. Stavros, Spyros Basilakos, Emmanuel N. Saridakis
**Relevance Score:** 5.4/10

The paper explores whether a minimal, single-field inflationary model can produce highly suppressed tensor perturbations, as increasingly tight observational bounds on primordial gravitational waves favor scenarios with very small tensor-to-scalar ratios. The authors propose a novel inflationary scenario using a modified Lennard-Jones potential, which combines a smooth minimum with an extended flat plateau, supporting slow-roll inflation and ensuring a graceful exit. They conduct a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics and find that the scalar spectral index aligns with CMB data, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is extremely small, around $r\sim10^{-7}$, and the running of the scalar spectral index is within recent observational bounds from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. This work demonstrates the feasibility of achieving highly suppressed tensor perturbations within a minimal, single-field framework, offering a new direction for inflationary model building.
