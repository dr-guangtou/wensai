### [Intracluster globular clusters as tracers of the mass assembly of the Hydra I galaxy cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15099)

**Authors:** Felipe S. Lohmann, Magda Arnaboldi, Michael Hilker, Andreas Burkert, Marilena Spavone, Ortwin Gerhard, Marina Rejkuba, Marco Mirabile, et al. (10 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

Deep VLT imaging of the Hydra I cluster reveals that blue globular clusters trace the extended intracluster potential and exhibit specific frequencies five times higher in the outskirts than in the center, enabling a novel reconstruction of the cluster's galaxy luminosity function evolution from a steeper faint-end slope of $\alpha=-1.81$ in the past to $\alpha=-1.41$ today.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS

- **Bimodal GC populations trace distinct potentials:** Red (metal-rich) globular clusters are concentrated around the central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, closely following the stellar light, while blue (metal-poor) GCs are spatially extended and offset from the cluster center, coinciding with a secondary peak in X-ray-emitting gas and tracing the global cluster gravitational potential.
- **Dichotomy in specific frequencies:** The specific frequency of blue GCs is approximately $5\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts compared to the inner regions dominated by red GCs, indicating a transition from galaxy-halo to cluster-potential tracing regimes.
- **Counter-intuitive central population gradients** *[verification needed]*: Within the central regions, young metal-rich GCs exhibit more extended distributions tentatively linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are surprisingly more centrally concentrated—possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies—representing a metallicity-spatial distribution reversal that challenges simple accretion scenarios.
- **Constraint on luminosity function evolution:** The study presents a new method using GC specific frequencies and color distributions to infer the past faint-end slope of the galaxy luminosity function ($\alpha=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$), which was significantly steeper than the present-day value ($\alpha=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$), consistent with high-redshift observations and hierarchical cosmological simulations.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observation type:** Deep optical imaging of extragalactic globular cluster systems.

**Methodologies:** The study utilizes deep $V$- and $I$-band imaging from VLT/FORS to identify GC candidates via the $VI$ color-magnitude diagram. Candidates are separated into blue (metal-poor) and red (metal-rich) subpopulations. Surface number density profiles are compared against the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311 and X-ray gas distributions to assess dynamical tracers. A novel modeling framework connects observed GC specific frequencies and color distributions to the evolution of the cluster galaxy luminosity function over cosmic time.

| Property | Value |

| Sample | Hydra I galaxy cluster (Abell 1060) |
| Distance | $45.7$ Mpc ($z \approx 0.011$) |
| Key instruments | VLT/FORS2 ($V$ and $I$ bands) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS

- **Observational Data:** ESO VLT/FORS2 archival imaging (proposal ID not specified in abstract; data available via ESO Science Archive Facility)
- **Ancillary Data:** X-ray emission maps of Hydra I (likely ROSAT, XMM-Newton, or Chandra; specific catalog not detailed in abstract)
- **Software:** Standard astronomical photometry packages (e.g., SExtractor, DAOPHOT) likely employed for source detection and point-spread function fitting; specific software citations require full text
- **Data Release:** GC candidate catalog and surface brightness profiles (availability to be confirmed in full paper)

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION

- **Hierarchical assembly tracers:** In galaxy clusters, hierarchical mass assembly predicts the formation of stellar substructures and intracluster light (ICL), which traces the global cluster potential rather than individual galaxies, but these features are often too faint for direct photometric detection at cosmological distances.
- **Globular clusters as mass probes:** GC systems serve as luminous, dynamically robust tracers of cluster assembly because they are collisionless and retain kinematic/memory of their formation/accretion environments, making them powerful alternatives to direct ICL studies for reconstructing the history of mass buildup.
- **Bimodal populations and origins:** The dichotomy between blue (metal-poor) and red (metal-rich) GC subpopulations is linked to distinct formation channels—typically in-situ formation versus accreted components—with their spatial distributions and specific frequencies encoding information about the host cluster's merger history and the disruption of dwarf galaxies over time.

### [Mechanisms Affecting Galaxies Nearby and Environmental Trends (MAGNET)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15142)

**Authors:** Benedetta Vulcani (INAF OaPD), Gabriella De Lucia, Daria Zakharova, Paolo Serra, Lizhi Xie, Stefania Barsanti, Bianca Maria Poggianti, Alessia Moretti, et al. (31 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Using the GAEA semi-analytic model, the authors find that over half of z~0 galaxies outside massive clusters have evolved since z=2 without experiencing mergers, tidal interactions, ram pressure stripping, or starvation, while the affected minority follow distinct mass-dependent pathways where mergers dominate massive systems and ram pressure stripping primarily quenches intermediate-mass galaxies in groups and filaments.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main result**: More than 50% of galaxies at z~0 remain unaffected by mergers, tidal interactions, ram pressure stripping (RPS), or starvation since z=2; among affected galaxies, mergers dominate at high stellar masses (40–60% at log(M*/Msun) > 10.5), RPS affects ~50% of intermediate-mass galaxies in groups and filaments, and starvation impacts 20–30% of the population across environments.
- **Methodology highlight**: Analysis of GAEA simulated volumes reconstructing evolutionary histories from z=2 to z~0, classifying galaxies into isolated, pair, group, and filament environments (excluding massive clusters) using both intrinsic 3D halo membership and observational 2D projected densities.
- **Projection effects**: Using 2D projected classifications artificially doubles the observed pair fraction while reducing the inferred fractions of isolated galaxies and group members compared to intrinsic 3D classifications, highlighting significant biases in observational environmental studies.
- **[Verification needed]**: The claim that >50% of galaxies are "unaffected" depends sensitively on GAEA's thresholds for defining significant environmental perturbations and may not account for weaker interactions or minor mergers that could still influence stellar mass growth or morphological evolution.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
- **Simulations used**: GAEA (GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly) semi-analytic model implemented on dark matter simulations (e.g., Millennium or Millennium-II), tracking baryonic processes including gas cooling, star formation, stellar and AGN feedback, and environmental physics (ram pressure stripping, tidal stripping, galaxy harassment).
- **Physical properties studied**: Stellar mass assembly histories, star formation suppression mechanisms, merger trees, tidal interaction strengths, and environmental classifications (isolated, pairs, groups, filaments) based on both halo-centric distances and projected local densities.
- **Reproduction of observations**: The model is used to generate theoretical predictions for the MAGNET survey; it broadly reproduces observed mass-environment correlations, though specific incidence rates for individual mechanisms await direct observational validation from the survey.
- **Key simulation references**: Hirschmann et al. (2016; GAEA model description), Xie et al. (2020; updates to feedback and environmental processes).

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- GAEA semi-analytic model outputs and source code: Available upon request from the authors or via the GAEA collaboration website (specific URL not provided in abstract).
- MAGNET survey data: Multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopy (VLT/MUSE, ALMA, etc.) to be released through ESO Science Archive Facility upon completion of observations.
- No specific GitHub repositories or public software tools are explicitly referenced in the provided abstract.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Galaxy evolution is regulated by the interplay between internal baryonic physics (gas accretion, feedback cycles) and external environmental mechanisms, yet distinguishing between specific processes—such as ram pressure stripping, starvation (strangulation), and tidal harassment—remains observationally challenging and theoretically critical for understanding the baryon cycle.
- The distinction between intrinsic environment (halo mass/membership) and observed environment (projected local density) is fundamental, as projection effects can misclassify galaxies and obscure the true physical drivers of quenching and morphological transformation.
- The MAGNET multi-wavelength program is designed to observationally discriminate between these specific mechanisms using spatially resolved kinematics and gas content measurements, requiring detailed theoretical predictions for the incidence rates and observable signatures of each process as a function of stellar mass and environment.

### [Bridging Scales in Black Hole Accretion and Feedback: Subgrid Prescription from First Principles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15560)

**Authors:** Hyerin Cho, Ben S. Prather, Ramesh Narayan, Kung-Yi Su, Angelo Ricarte, Priyamvada Natarajan, Antonio J. Porras-Valverde
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Using multizone GRMHD simulations that self-consistently span the event horizon to the Bondi radius (reaching dynamical equilibrium across scales), the authors derive first-principles, spin-dependent subgrid prescriptions for hot-mode black hole accretion and feedback, finding that black hole spins remain effectively frozen during quiescent phases (spindown timescales of ~12 Gyr) and that small-scale simulations systematically fail to capture long-term galactic-scale behavior.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Derived analytic subgrid prescriptions**: Provided compact fitting functions for time-averaged accretion rate $\dot M(R_B,a_\ast)$ and feedback power $\dot E_{\rm fb}(R_B,a_\ast)$ relative to the Bondi rate, applicable for hot accretion flows with Eddington ratios $f_{\rm Edd}\lesssim10^{-3}$; results are largely insensitive to initial gas configuration and magnetic field strength
- **Multi-scale GRMHD methodology**: Conducted long-duration simulations spanning black hole spins $|a_\ast|=0$--0.9 and Bondi radii $R_B/r_g=4\times10^2$--$2\times10^6$ using a multizone framework that captures bidirectional inflow-outflow coupling from the event horizon to the Bondi scale
- **Frozen spins in quiescence**: Measured self-consistent spin evolution finding spin-up parameter $s(a_\ast)\simeq -3.7\,a_\ast$, implying a very long spindown timescale $t_s\simeq 12(10^{-3}/f_{\rm Edd})\,$Gyr—effectively freezing spin evolution during hot-mode accretion and maintaining initial spin distributions over cosmic time
- **Intrinsic variability characterized**: Quantified lognormal distributions for both $\dot M$ and feedback efficiency $\eta$, with distribution widths increasing toward larger Bondi radii, providing statistical constraints for stochastic subgrid implementations in cosmological codes

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Simulation-based study** employing a "multizone framework" to perform long-duration General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. This approach uniquely captures the full dynamic range from the event horizon ($r_g$) to the Bondi radius ($R_B$), achieving dynamical equilibrium across horizon-to-galaxy scales rather than relying on boundary conditions at small radii.

**Key simulation parameters:**
- Spin range: $|a_\ast| = 0$ to $0.9$ (dimensionless Kerr parameter)
- Spatial dynamic range: $R_B/r_g = 4\times10^2$ to $2\times10^6$ (Bondi radius to gravitational radius)
- Accretion mode: Hot, radiatively inefficient flows with $f_{\rm Edd}\lesssim10^{-3}$
- Physics captured: Self-consistent inflow-outflow cycles, magnetic field amplification, feedback energetics, and black hole spin evolution

**Critical comparison**: The study demonstrates that conventional small-domain GRMHD calculations (which terminate at small radii far inside the Bondi radius) yield systematically different long-term accretion rates, feedback efficiencies, and spin evolution compared to large-domain simulations that reach dynamical equilibrium. This cautions against direct extrapolation of small-scale simulation results for constructing galactic-scale subgrid models in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models.

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **arXiv preprint**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15560
- **Analytic fits**: Compact fitting functions provided for $\dot M(R_B, a_\ast)$ and $\dot E_{\rm fb}(R_B, a_\ast)$ relative to Bondi accretion rates
- **Variability statistics**: Lognormal distribution parameters (widths and means) for $\dot M$ and $\eta$ as functions of $R_B$
- **Spin evolution tracks**: Self-consistent spin evolution measurements for the hot accretion mode

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Cosmological simulations require subgrid models to bridge the vast spatial dynamic range from black hole event horizons ($\sim$ gravitational radii) to galactic bulges ($\sim$ Bondi radii), yet conventional small-domain GRMHD simulations may inadequately capture the long-term dynamical equilibrium and bidirectional inflow-outflow coupling necessary for accurate subgrid prescriptions
- Hot, radiatively inefficient accretion flows at low Eddington ratios ($f_{\rm Edd}\lesssim10^{-3}$) represent the dominant mode of supermassive black hole growth in typical galaxies, where gravitational binding energy is released through outflows and convection rather than radiation, making feedback coupling to the host galaxy particularly important but poorly constrained by first-principles calculations
- Black hole spin evolution in quiescent (hot-mode) phases has remained uncertain, with critical implications for jet power, accretion efficiency, and the spin distribution of the supermassive black hole population, requiring self-consistent modeling of angular momentum transport across the full inflow-outflow cycle from the Bondi capture radius to the horizon

### [AGN in massive galaxies identified via optical broadband variability: lessons from VST-COSMOS for future LSST science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15123)

**Authors:** B. Bichang'a, D. De Cicco, S. Kaviraj, I. Lazar, A. Watkins, G. Martin, D. Kakkad
**Relevance Score:** 8.5/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Optical variability-selected AGN in massive galaxies (M* > 10^10 M⊙) at z < 1 display morphologies, interaction rates, and environments statistically indistinguishable from non-AGN controls, suggesting that secular processes rather than major mergers dominate black hole fueling in this regime.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **AGN identified via 11-year optical variability** in VST-COSMOS show host-galaxy properties consistent with the general population: ~55% exhibit early-type morphologies and ~23% show interaction signatures, rates statistically similar to a mass- and redshift-matched control sample of non-variable galaxies.
- **Environmental and color analysis reveals no anomalies:** AGN hosts have rest-frame (u-z) colors and local environments comparable to controls, indicating that recent star formation histories and galaxy surroundings are typical for massive galaxies at these redshifts.
- **[Claim requiring verification]:** The conclusion that AGN are "not primarily triggered by interactions" assumes that morphological disturbances persist for timescales comparable to or longer than the AGN duty cycle; if AGN activity significantly lags the merger event (by >1 Gyr), the interaction fraction could be underestimated while the AGN is still active.
- **LSST precursor validation:** VST-COSMOS provides a near-perfect analog to LSST with identical single-visit depth (r ~ 24.6 mag) and baseline (~11 years), demonstrating that future LSST variability samples will detect AGN in massive hosts with sufficient fidelity to constrain fueling mechanisms across four orders of magnitude larger survey area.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational study** using variability-selected AGN in the COSMOS field with matched-pair control analysis.

- **Methodology:** AGN selection via broadband optical variability over 11 years; morphological classification (early vs. late type) and interaction identification (visual or automated disturbance detection); comparison to control sample matched in stellar mass and redshift drawn from the non-variable population; analysis of rest-frame colors and local overdensity metrics.
- **Key comparisons:** Fraction of early-type hosts, interaction rates, (u-z) colors, and environmental densities between AGN and control samples.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | 56 AGN + matched control sample |
| Redshift range | z < 1 |
| Stellar mass | M* > 10^10 M⊙ |
| Key instruments | VST (VLT Survey Telescope), OmegaCAM |
| Survey depth | r ~ 24.6 mag (single visit) |

**Citation to note:** VST-COSMOS survey (De Cicco et al. relevant VST-COSMOS data release)

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **VST-COSMOS survey data:** Optical imaging (ugri bands) from the VLT Survey Telescope (VST)
- **COSMOS photometric redshift catalog:** For redshift and stellar mass estimates (likely Ilbert et al. or Laigle et al. COSMOS2015/2020 catalogs)
- **Morphological analysis tools:** [Not specified in abstract; typically GALFIT, SExtractor, or CNN-based classifiers for COSMOS morphologies]
- **Variability metrics:** Structure function or chi-squared variability detection in r-band light curves

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **AGN selection biases:** Traditional color/line-selection methods (e.g., BPT diagnostics, IRAC power-law selection) miss low-luminosity or obscured AGN, making variability a crucial complementary technique that is sensitive to accretion disk fluctuations regardless of line-of-sight obscuration.
- **Merger-driven vs. secular fueling:** The longstanding debate regarding whether supermassive black hole growth is primarily triggered by major mergers (classical picture) or by stochastic secular processes (disk instabilities, minor mergers, bar-driven inflow) in massive galaxies, and the need for unbiased AGN samples to test these paradigms.
- **LSST preparatory science:** The necessity of validating variability selection techniques, completeness estimates, and contamination rates (e.g., from supernovae or variable stars) in precursor surveys with LSST-like depth and cadence to prepare for the deluge of >10^7 variable AGN expected from the 10-year LSST survey.

### [The dependence of triggering mechanisms on radio AGN sub-types: the role of galaxy mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15109)

**Authors:** Freya Barwell, Clive N. Tadhunter, Jonathon C. S. Pierce, Aaron E. Watkins, Yjan Gordon, Luke R. Holden, Lydia Makrygianni, Dustin T. Mason, et al. (13 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
High-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) exhibit a significantly higher rate of morphological disturbance (62%) compared to both low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs, 36%) and a stellar mass-matched control sample, providing strong evidence that HERGs are predominantly triggered by galaxy mergers while LERGs accrete via alternative mechanisms, and demonstrating that FRII LERGs do not represent a simple "switched-off" phase of FRII HERGs from the same parent population.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Distinct triggering mechanisms**: HERGs show a 62$^{+6}_{-7}$ per cent rate of morphological disturbance—a ~4$\sigma$ excess over the control sample—while LERGs show 36$^{+7}_{-6}$ per cent, consistent with the control, suggesting mergers trigger HERGs but not LERGs.
- **Robust sample**: The study achieves 98 per cent completeness for 112 3CR radio galaxies at $z < 0.3$ using deep INT/WFC and Gemini/GMOS-S imaging, with careful stellar mass matching to control galaxies.
- **Population distinction**: FRII HERGs preferentially reside in disturbed morphologies compared to FRII LERGs (a ~3$\sigma$ difference), challenging the hypothesis that FRII LERGs are merely "switched-off" versions of the same parent galaxy population in a different evolutionary phase.
- **Accretion mode connection**: The morphological results support a picture where HERGs accrete cold gas via mergers while LERGs accrete from hot X-ray haloes without requiring major mergers.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

This is an **observational imaging study** using deep optical imaging to identify morphological signatures of galaxy mergers as a function of AGN excitation class.

The authors conducted a deep imaging survey using the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Wide Field Camera (WFC), supplemented by Gemini South Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS-S) imaging to achieve high completeness. Morphological disturbance was assessed (likely via visual inspection or quantitative asymmetry metrics) to identify merger remnants and interacting systems. The sample draws from the 3CR catalogue of powerful radio galaxies, with stellar mass-matched control galaxies to isolate the effect of AGN triggering mechanisms from mass-dependent morphological trends.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | N = 112 (3CR radio galaxies) |
| Redshift range | $z < 0.3$ |
| Completeness | 98% |
| Key instruments | INT/WFC, Gemini/GMOS-S |
| Control sample | Stellar mass-matched galaxies |
| Data products | Deep optical imaging, morphological disturbance classifications |
| Citation to note | 3CR catalogue (Laing, Riley & Longair 1983) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **3CR Catalogue**: The Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources, providing the parent sample of powerful radio galaxies
- **INT/WFC Imaging**: Deep optical imaging from the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera survey
- **Gemini/GMOS-S**: Supplemental imaging from the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on Gemini South
- **Stellar mass-matched control sample**: Comparison galaxies matched in stellar mass to the 3CR hosts (specific selection criteria not detailed in abstract)

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Radio AGN feedback is a critical process in galaxy evolution models, but properly incorporating these systems requires understanding whether different AGN sub-types are triggered by the same physical mechanisms (e.g., galaxy mergers vs. hot halo accretion).
- The HERG/LERG dichotomy reflects fundamentally different accretion states: HERGs accrete cold gas via radiatively efficient thin disks, while LERGs accrete hot gas via radiatively inefficient flows, yet the role of mergers in triggering each class remains observationally unclear.
- An ongoing debate concerns whether LERGs represent a "switched-off" evolutionary phase of HERGs from the same parent galaxy population, or whether they constitute physically distinct systems with different triggering histories and host galaxy properties.

### [Aligned and misaligned metallicity gradients in young stars and star-forming regions in the EAGLE discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15604)

**Authors:** Isha Shailesh, Patricia B. Tissera, Emanuel Sillero
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
The alignment or misalignment of radial oxygen abundance gradients between young stars (<2 Gyr old) and star-forming gas in EAGLE disc galaxies traces distinct evolutionary pathways over the past ~2 Gyr, distinguishing between sustained inside-out growth, active feedback disruption, and recovery from violent perturbations.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Four evolutionary classes**: Galaxies classified by gradient sign combinations (NN: negative-negative, NP: negative-positive, PP: positive-positive, PN: positive-negative) exhibit distinct histories; NN systems show sustained inside-out growth with high star formation efficiency, while PP galaxies are predominantly shaped by supernova feedback-driven disruption.
- **Simulation methodology**: Analysis of the high-resolution EAGLE cosmological simulation using azimuthally averaged radial oxygen abundance profiles fitted with linear models to quantify metallicity slopes in young stellar populations (age < 2 Gyr) and star-forming gas.
- **Recovery signatures**: PN galaxies (positive young star, negative gas gradients) display evidence of past violent events followed by gradient recovery, highlighting the role of gas inflows and cooling in re-establishing metallicity structure—this represents a transient evolutionary phase not previously emphasized in gradient studies.
- **Model dependencies**: The classification scheme provides a temporal diagnostic for significant evolutionary events, though the inferred timescales and feedback strengths depend on EAGLE's specific sub-grid physics implementations for metal diffusion and energy feedback.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Simulation-based study**

- **Simulations used**: High-resolution run of the EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation project. *Note: The specific resolution variant (likely Recal-L025N0752 or higher resolution volume) and total galaxy sample size are not specified in the abstract.*
- **Physical properties studied**: Radial oxygen abundance profiles for young stars (YS, age < 2 Gyr) and star-forming gas (SFG); azimuthally averaged and fitted with linear functions to determine gradient slopes and their signs.
- **Reproducing observations**: The study establishes a theoretical framework for interpreting observed metallicity gradient alignments; explicit comparison to observational datasets is framed as future work necessary to constrain sub-grid physics models.
- **Key references**: Schaye et al. 2015 (EAGLE main paper); Crain et al. 2015 (EAGLE sub-grid physics).

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- EAGLE public database: http://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle/
- *Note: Specific analysis software packages (e.g., yt, pynbody, or custom EAGLE post-processing tools) are not detailed in the available abstract.*

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Radial metallicity gradients in disc galaxies encode the competition between gas accretion, star formation, feedback-driven metal mixing, and secular evolution, with negative gradients typically indicating canonical inside-out disc growth.
- Young stellar populations and HII region gas serve as contemporaneous tracers of recent chemical enrichment and dynamical perturbations, offering a ~2 Gyr snapshot of the galaxy's immediate evolutionary state distinct from older stellar populations.
- Gradient inversions (positive slopes) or flattening are theorized to result from gas inflows, merger-induced mixing, or strong feedback events that disrupt the established metallicity structure, but the timescales for gradient recovery remain observationally unconstrained.

**Verification notes**: The arXiv ID 2602.15604 appears to contain a date error (likely 2502.15604 or 2402.15604). Specific sample sizes, redshift coverage, and numerical resolution parameters are not provided in the abstract and require verification in the full text. Claims linking gradient configurations to specific evolutionary mechanisms (e.g., "predominantly shaped by supernova feedback") are interpretations based on EAGLE's particular sub-grid models and should be validated against other hydrodynamical simulations.

### [Deep Learning for Point Spread Function Modeling in Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15780)

**Authors:** Dayana Andrea Henao Arbel\'aez, Pierre-Fran\c{c}ois L\'eget, Andr\'es Alejandro Plazas Malag\'on
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
A deep learning framework combining an autoencoder with Gaussian process interpolation models the Point Spread Function across the full focal plane with $3.4 \times 10^{-6}$ reconstruction error, marginally outperforming the current PIFF standard ($3.7 \times 10^{-6}$) while preserving spatial coherence lost in independent CCD-based approaches, with direct applications for LSST weak gravitational lensing cosmology.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Quantified improvement:** The hybrid model achieves a PSF reconstruction error of $3.4 \times 10^{-6}$, compared to PIFF's $3.7 \times 10^{-6}$ (roughly 8% reduction in error), though the absolute improvement is small relative to the precision requirements of next-generation surveys.
- **Methodological innovation:** Uses an autoencoder trained on stellar images from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on Subaru, coupled with a Gaussian process to interpolate PSF variations smoothly across the entire focal plane rather than modeling CCDs as disconnected islands.
- **Systematic gain:** Captures large-scale spatial coherence and systematic variations across the focal plane that PIFF misses due to its independent per-CCD modeling approach, potentially reducing spatially correlated systematics in cosmic shear measurements.
- **Survey integration:** Explicitly developed for integration into the LSST Science Pipelines, targeting weak lensing analyses where PSF modeling biases directly propagate into dark energy constraints from cosmic shear.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Paper Type:** Methodological/Observational (data-driven algorithm development using existing survey data)

**Methodology Summary:**
The authors employ a hybrid deep learning approach where an autoencoder learns compressed representations of stellar PSF images from HSC data, while a Gaussian process regression handles the spatial interpolation of these latent features across the full field of view. This addresses the "patchwork" limitation of PIFF, which fits polynomial surfaces independently on each CCD and therefore cannot enforce continuity at chip boundaries. The model is trained and validated on real stellar observations (not simulations) from the Subaru telescope, benchmarked against the current state-of-the-art PIFF algorithm used by DES, HSC, and Rubin/LSST.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample | Stellar point sources from HSC imaging |
| Instrument | Hyper Suprime-Cam (Subaru 8.2m) |
| Redshift range | N/A (calibration uses local stellar PSFs) |
| Target surveys | DES, HSC, LSST (Rubin Observatory) |
| Key metrics | Reconstruction error: $3.4 \times 10^{-6}$ (DL+GP) vs $3.7 \times 10^{-6}$ (PIFF) |
| Algorithm components | Autoencoder + Gaussian Process |
| Comparison baseline | PIFF (PSF in the Full Field-of-View) |
| Data products | PSF model suitable for weak lensing shear inference |

**Citation to note:** Jarvis et al. (2021) or similar reference establishing PIFF as the state-of-the-art for current surveys (implied by comparison framework).

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- **Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey data:** Publicly available Subaru/HSC imaging data used for training and validation (accessible via the Subaru Mitaka website or HSC data release portal)
- **PIFF (PSF in the Full Field-of-View):** The current state-of-the-art PSF modeling software against which results are benchmarked
- **LSST Science Pipelines:** Target integration framework for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time
- **Software stack:** Deep learning framework (likely PyTorch/TensorFlow for the autoencoder) combined with Gaussian process implementation (possibly GPyTorch or scikit-learn), though specific repositories are not cited in the abstract

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **PSF-cosmology connection:** Systematic errors in PSF modeling constitute a dominant systematic for weak gravitational lensing, propagating directly into cosmic shear measurements that constrain dark energy equation of state and the growth of large-scale structure.
- **Spatial coherence problem:** Current industry-standard methods (PIFF) sacrifice physical realism by treating each CCD as an independent modeling domain, creating artificial discontinuities at chip boundaries and losing the global "fingerprint" of optical and atmospheric effects that vary smoothly across the focal plane.
- **Shift to data-driven models:** The field is transitioning from parametric optical models or pure polynomial interpolation toward machine learning approaches that can capture complex, non-analytic PSF variations (atmospheric turbulence, detector effects, optical aberrations) directly from calibration star observations.

### [WISDOM Project - XXVII. Giant molecular clouds of the lenticular galaxy NGC 1387: similarities with spiral galaxy clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15792)

**Authors:** Fu-Heng Liang, Martin Bureau, Lijie Liu, Pandora Dominiak, Woorak Choi, Timothy A. Davis, Jacob Elford, Jindra Gensior, et al. (13 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
High-resolution ALMA observations of the lenticular galaxy NGC 1387 reveal that its 1,285 identified giant molecular clouds follow Larson-like scaling relations nearly identical to those in spiral galaxies like the Milky Way, challenging the assumption that early-type galaxies host systematically distinct, more turbulent cloud populations.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS (3-4 bullet points)
- **Spiral-like cloud physics in an S0 galaxy**: The 1,285 GMCs in NGC 1387 follow scaling relations (radius-velocity dispersion-mass) remarkably similar to the Milky Way disc and Local Group spirals, with most clouds appearing virialised—unusual for early-type galaxies which typically show deviations suggesting higher turbulence or pressure confinement.
- **Angular momentum dichotomy**: GMCs with large masses ($M \gtrsim$ few $\times 10^5 M_\odot$), large radii, and/or small galactocentric distances ($R_{\rm gal}$) show angular momenta aligned with the galaxy's large-scale rotation, while lower-mass, smaller, or peripheral clouds exhibit no preferred alignment, suggesting distinct formation or survival mechanisms for massive/central clouds.
- **Resolution and methodology**: Analysis exploits ALMA 12CO(2-1) data at 0.15" resolution (14 pc physical scale) processed with a modified version of the CPROPStoo cloud-identification package, enabling robust measurement of cloud properties down to individual star-forming units in an ETG for the first time.
- **Viewing-angle implications**: The results suggest that the apparent "diversity" of GMC properties in ETGs may partially reflect viewing-angle dependencies (e.g., inclination effects on detected cloud populations) rather than intrinsic differences in cloud physics, complicating comparisons between galaxy types.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational study** exploiting interferometric molecular line emission.

- **Methodology**: The team identified individual GMCs using a modified CPROPStoo algorithm (an extension of the classic CPROPS method) on ALMA 12CO(2-1) moment maps. They extracted fundamental properties (effective radius $\sigma_r$, line-of-sight velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$, and luminous mass $M_{\rm mol}$) and computed virial parameters ($\alpha_{\rm vir}$). Angular momentum vectors were derived from velocity gradients within each cloud and compared to the galaxy's systemic rotation axis.
- **Target**: NGC 1387—a lenticular (S0) galaxy in the Fornax cluster with a prominent bulge and disc, chosen as a representative ETG with detectable molecular gas.
- **Analysis**: The study compared the resulting scaling relations (Larson's laws) to reference samples including the Milky Way, M51, and other Local Group spirals, and performed kinematic analyses to assess the dynamical state (virial equilibrium) and angular momentum alignment of the cloud population.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **ETG molecular cloud paradigm**: Prior to this work, early-type galaxies were hypothesized to host GMCs with systematically higher velocity dispersions and non-virialised states compared to spirals, attributed to their hotter interstellar media, stronger tidal fields, and different dynamical heating histories.
- **Viewing angle degeneracy**: The physical interpretation of molecular gas in lenticular galaxies suffers from orientation biases—edge-on vs. face-on viewing angles may preferentially detect different cloud populations (e.g., disc vs. bulge clouds), potentially explaining the apparent heterogeneity of ETG GMC properties in the literature.
- **Angular momentum as a probe**: The alignment of individual cloud angular momenta with galactic rotation distinguishes between "spiral arm" formation modes (coherent rotation) and stochastic turbulent fragmentation (random orientations), providing constraints on cloud survival times and accretion histories in bulge-dominated environments.

**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

The dynamical origin of spiral arms and their rotation speeds (pattern speeds) remain controversial, with conflicting observational results. This study analyzes high-resolution cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies (Auriga Superstars) to investigate spiral structure formation. The simulations reveal that different galaxies realize distinct theoretical models—some host long-lived density waves or bar-driven manifold spirals, while others exhibit transient, co-rotating arms. Individual galaxies can transition between these states on sub-billion-year timescales, demonstrating that without strong external encounters or bars, spiral arms are typically short-lived, complex structures rather than permanent wave patterns.

### [Magnetohydrodynamic Precipitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15121)

**Authors:** G. M. Voit, B. D. Wibking, D. Yaldiz
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

• **Problem:** Hot atmospheres around massive galaxies can become unstable to "precipitation" of cold clouds, but how magnetic fields influence this process has been poorly understood.

• **Approach:** The authors develop a theoretical magnetohydrodynamic framework to explain how weak fields affect precipitation, complementing recent numerical simulations.

• **Results:** Relatively weak magnetic fields significantly enhance an atmosphere's tendency to produce cold clouds and organize the gas into vertically elongated, highly magnetized filaments that descend at sub-Keplerian speeds toward the galaxy's center.

• **Significance:** This provides essential guidance for interpreting both simulations and observations of filamentary gas structures in hot galactic halos.

### [Detecting the neutrino mass via the cross-correlation between matter tracers and the ISWRS effect?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15688)

**Authors:** Viviana Cuozzo, Marina Migliaccio, Matteo Calabrese, Carmelita Carbone
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

• **Question:** Can cross-correlations between future CMB and large-scale structure surveys detect the faint nonlinear Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (Rees-Sciama) signal, and can this constrain the sum of neutrino masses (Mν)?

• **Methods:** The authors model cross-correlations between the ISWRS effect and matter tracers—specifically CMB lensing, galaxy clustering, and cosmic shear—forecasting detectability for upcoming experiments like CMB-HD, CMB-S4, and Euclid while including massive neutrino effects.

• **Results:** CMB-HD's lensing potential should detect the ISWRS effect at >5σ significance even under conservative noise assumptions, distinguishing massive neutrino cosmologies from standard ΛCDM. Galaxy clustering also shows significant promise, though cosmic shear requires improved nonlinear modeling.

• **Conclusion:** While these probes will likely enable the first robust detection of the ISWRS effect, they offer limited constraining power on Mν, suggesting that near-future surveys will not significantly advance neutrino mass measurements despite detecting the signal.

### [Barium Stars Across the Milky Way: Probing Their Origins via the GALAH Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15107)

**Authors:** Jaden Levine, Catherine Manea, Keith Hawkins, Kendall Sullivan, Kate H. R. Rubin, Zachary Maas, Andrew C. Nine
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

- **Background**: Barium stars exhibit extreme barium enrichment ([Ba/Fe] ≥ 1.0) that contradicts standard Galactic chemical evolution models, with debated origins in binary mass transfer from AGB stars or internal radiative levitation.

- **Approach**: The authors identified ~3,000 new barium-rich candidates from ~450,000 GALAH survey stars, separating them by temperature and cross-matching with Gaia DR3 to assess binarity via astrometric noise (RUWE), while mapping kinematic and chemical membership across the Galaxy.

- **Key Results**: Nearly half of nearby barium stars (47.7%) show elevated binary indicators compared to 16.3% of field stars, strongly favoring mass transfer as the dominant formation channel; however, a subset of hot, metal-poor stars with low binarity support radiative levitation as a secondary mechanism. Both populations exist ubiquitously from the thin disk to the halo.

- **Implications**: These findings demonstrate that barium stars form through both binary interaction and intrinsic stellar processes, challenging current models of AGB nucleosynthesis, binary evolution, and chemical enrichment throughout the Milky Way.

Current observational large-scale structure (LSS) catalogues lack consistent criteria for assigning galaxies to cosmic web components, preventing effective training of machine learning classification algorithms. This work introduces a geometrical simulator using Voronoi tessellation—mapping tessellation nodes, links, surfaces, and cells to clusters, filaments, walls, and voids—to generate synthetic galaxy catalogues with pre-assigned structural labels. The resulting mocks statistically replicate observed galaxy distributions within specific structures (calibrated to SDSS data) while incorporating observational effects such as Malmquist bias and Fingers of God. These pre-labelled synthetic datasets provide essential ground truth for calibrating LSS classification algorithms, benchmarking different methods, and training deep learning models to automatically identify cosmic web environments.

### [An observational test of the plasma lensing effect using QSOs with and without MgII absorption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15558)

**Authors:** Xinzhong Er, Yiping Shu, Chenxu Liu
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

• **Problem**: Distinguishing plasma lensing—magnification of radio emission by compact ionized gas clumps—from dust extinction in quasar observations, using MgII absorption as a tracer of intervening material.

• **Method**: Comparison of ~4,000 QSOs with MgII absorbers against ~12,000 non-absorbers using multi-wavelength data (radio VLASS, infrared WISE, and optical DESI), including control samples matched in redshift and luminosity.

• **Key Finding**: While the MgII sample initially shows a moderate radio excess at bright fluxes consistent with plasma lensing predictions, this signal weakens significantly after controlling for redshift and optical/infrared luminosity, suggesting the apparent magnification is not robust evidence for plasma lensing.

• **Implications**: The multi-wavelength flux differences constrain the physical state of the intervening gas, though dust extinction remains a viable alternative explanation to plasma lensing.
