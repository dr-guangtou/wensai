### [There and back again? Neutral outflows in z~3.5 quiescent galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17767)

**Authors:** Pengpei Zhu, Kei Ito, Francesco Valentino, Massissilia Hamadouche, Gianluca Scarpe, Katherine E. Whitaker, Takumi Kakimoto, William M. Baker, et al. (19 total)
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
JWST observations of 23 massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim3.5$ reveal that while neutral gas outflows (traced by NaI D) are prevalent and capable of suppressing star formation, they likely fail to escape the galaxy potential, suggesting a cycle of gas recycling rather than permanent quenching.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
*   **Detection Statistics:** Neutral gas outflows traced by the NaI D doublet were detected in 57% (13/23) of the sample, with 30% (7/23) showing significant blueshifted absorption ($|\Delta v| > 150$ km/s).
*   **Outflow Properties:** Outflow velocities at $z\sim3.5$ are comparable to local counterparts; one system exhibits an extreme mass outflow rate of $\log(\dot M_{\rm out} / \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr}^{-1})=2.68\pm0.27$, coincident with an X-ray AGN.
*   **Quenching Implications:** While outflow rates are theoretically sufficient to suppress star formation, the gas is unlikely to escape the host galaxy, predicting short recycling timescales of 3–180 Myr.
*   **AGN Connection:** All NaI D detected targets show LI(N)ER emission or X-ray detection, yet the correlation with ongoing AGN activity is ambiguous (2/4 broad-line/X-ray AGNs were undetected in NaI D), suggesting outflows may be driven by episodic or "fossil" AGN feedback.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational Paper Details:**
*   **Methodology:** The study utilizes JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy (R~1000) to identify neutral outflows via the NaI D (λλ5890, 5896) absorption doublet. Stellar population synthesis modeling was used to derive stellar masses and characterize the quiescent nature of the targets. Mass outflow rates were estimated using the observed absorption properties and assumptions about the launching radius and potential.
*   **Quick Reference Table:**

| Sample size | 23 quiescent galaxies |
| Redshift range | $z = 2.82 - 4.61$ |
| Stellar Mass range | $M_\star = 10^{10.1-11.6}\,\rm M_\odot$ |
| Key instruments | JWST NIRSpec (R~1000), NIRCam |
| Data products | DeepDive Survey (JWST Program) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
*   **Datasets:** Data derived from the **DeepDive** JWST program (NIRSpec and NIRCam).
*   **Tools:** No specific software repositories or external database URLs were cited in the provided text.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*   **Role of Neutral Outflows:** Neutral gas outflows are a critical, yet poorly constrained, component of the baryon cycle that governs the transition from star-forming to quiescent phases in galaxy evolution.
*   **High-z Context:** While outflows are well-studied locally, the properties of neutral gas in massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift ($z>2.5$) remain largely unexplored due to observational limitations (shifting NaI D to NIR).
*   **Quenching vs. Maintenance:** A key open question is whether outflows permanently quench galaxies by ejecting gas or if they represent a "maintenance mode" where gas cycles in and out of the interstellar medium without escaping the halo.

### [MATLAS-42, A Globular Cluster-Rich Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy That Diverges from the "Failed Galaxy'' Formation Pathway](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18046)

**Authors:** Jonah S. Gannon, Duncan A. Forbes, Francine R. Marleau, Anna Ferr\'e-Mateu, Aaron J. Romanowsky, Maria Luisa Buzzo, Jean P. Brodie
**Relevance Score:** 9.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Spectroscopic analysis of the gas-rich, globular cluster-rich ultra-diffuse galaxy MATLAS-42 reveals a young stellar population and recent star formation, challenging the "failed galaxy" formation pathway typically attributed to GC-rich UDGs.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Stellar Population Properties:** The galaxy is young (mass-weighted age $=3.2^{+2.6}_{-1.5}$ Gyr) and has average-to-low metallicity ([M/H] $= -1.19^{+0.42}_{-0.30}$ dex), contradicting the old, quenched profile expected for "failed galaxies."
- **Kinematic Confirmation:** Spectroscopic measurements confirm the galaxy is part of the NGC 502 group ($V_{\rm R, \star}=2433\pm8$ km s$^{-1}$) and is associated with its HI reservoir ($V_{\rm R,HI}=2423\pm 15$ km s$^{-1}$).
- **Formation Pathway Divergence:** Unlike passive, GC-rich cluster UDGs, MATLAS-42 shows evidence of recent star formation, suggesting it does not follow the "failed galaxy" pathway (or has rejuvenated).
- **Evolutionary Model:** A toy model suggests the galaxy's relative GC-richness ($M_{\rm GC}/M_\star$) will decrease over time due to GC evaporation, implying it is not a progenitor of typical "failed galaxy" UDGs.

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS
**Observational Study:**
- The study utilized the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) to obtain integrated spectroscopy of MATLAS-42.
- Key observables included stellar kinematics (redshift) and integrated stellar population parameters (age, metallicity).
- The authors constructed a toy model to simulate the passive evolution of the galaxy, specifically tracking the ratio of globular cluster mass to stellar mass over time.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | N = 1 (MATLAS-42) |
| Environment | NGC 502 group |
| Key instruments | Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) |
| Stellar Velocity | $2433\pm8$ km s$^{-1}$ |
| HI Velocity | $2423\pm 15$ km s$^{-1}$ |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- No specific URLs, databases, or software repositories were cited in the provided abstract.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- **The "Failed Galaxy" Paradigm:** GC-rich UDGs are often interpreted as "failed galaxies"—objects with massive dark matter halos that formed stars early but were quenched prematurely, remaining quenched thereafter.
- **Observational Bias:** The evidence for this paradigm relies heavily on spectroscopic studies of passive, GC-rich UDGs specifically within galaxy clusters.
- **Environmental Dependence:** There is a gap in the literature regarding GC-rich UDGs in group environments or those with gas reservoirs, necessitating the study of objects like MATLAS-42 to test the universality of the "failed galaxy" model.

### [Investigating the role of mergers in galaxy assembly in the early Universe (z > 5)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18068)

**Authors:** A. Calabr\`o, L. Pentericci, M. Llerena, S. Rossi, L. Napolitano, D. Bevacqua, M. Giavalisco, R. Somerville, et al. (23 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
By analyzing JWST imaging of 1233 spectroscopic galaxies at $z > 5$, this study finds that while the morphological merger fraction remains nearly constant at $\sim 5\%$ to $z \sim 8$, the merger rate increases sharply to $\sim 2$ mergers/galaxy/Gyr, enhancing star formation rates by a factor of 1.7 but contributing only 5–10% to total stellar mass buildup.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
*   **Merger Fraction vs. Rate Evolution:** The morphological merger fraction ($f_m$) shows weak evolution from $z=0$ to $z \sim 8$ (averaging $\sim 5\%$ for major mergers). However, accounting for the shrinking observability timescale of tidal disturbances at high-$z$, the derived merger rate increases by $>1$ dex from $z=1$ to $z=7$, reaching $\sim 2$ mergers/galaxy/Gyr at $5 < z < 10$.
*   **Star Formation Enhancement:** Merging galaxies at $z > 5$ exhibit Star Formation Rates (SFRs) 1.7 times higher than a mass- and redshift-matched control sample of non-mergers (averaged over 10 Myr), indicating that mergers trigger short, bursty star-forming episodes even in the early Universe.
*   **Limited Mass Assembly Contribution:** Despite the high merger rate, mergers contribute only $5\% - 10\%$ to the total stellar mass build-up at $z > 5$, suggesting that in-situ star formation driven by gas accretion dominates mass assembly in this epoch.
*   **Methodology:** The study utilized a large spectroscopic sample (1233 galaxies) across six extragalactic fields, identifying mergers via non-parametric morphology parameters (Gini, $M_{20}$, Asymmetry) measured on JWST/NIRCam F444W imaging (rest-frame optical).

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational Study**

*   **Methodology:** The authors identified mergers using quantitative morphological diagnostics on rest-frame optical images (JWST F444W). They employed a combination of Gini ($G$), $M_{20}$, and Asymmetry ($A$) parameters to identify disturbances. They defined a primary selection for major mergers ($G + 0.14 \times M_{20} > 0.33$ and $A > 0.35$) and a broader selection for major+minor mergers. SED fitting with non-parametric Star Formation Histories (SFH) was performed to derive stellar masses and SFRs.
*   **Quick Reference Table:**

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sample size | 1233 galaxies (spectroscopic) |
| Redshift range | $5 < z < 14$ (focus on $5 < z < 10$) |
| Key instruments | JWST NIRCam (F444W), HST (photometry) |
| Data products | Imaging (morphology), Photometry (SEDs) |
| Merger Criteria (Major) | $G + 0.14 M_{20} > 0.33$ AND $A > 0.35$ |
| Merger Rate ($5 < z < 10$) | $\sim 2$ mergers/galaxy/Gyr (Major) |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
*   **Data:** JWST imaging from six extragalactic fields (specific survey names not listed in abstract, but typically include CEERS, JADES, PRIMER, etc.).
*   **Software/Code:** No specific URLs or GitHub repositories mentioned in the provided text.

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
*   **Merger Fraction vs. Rate Degeneracy:** A constant or slowly evolving merger fraction with redshift does not imply a constant merger rate; the "observability timescale" during which a merger looks disturbed decreases significantly at higher redshifts due to surface brightness dimming and faster dynamical times.
*   **High-Redshift Morphology:** Prior to JWST, morphological studies at $z > 5$ were limited to rest-frame UV, which traces clumpy star formation rather than the underlying mass distribution; rest-frame optical imaging is required to reliably identify merger-induced disturbances.
*   **Mass Assembly Mechanisms:** There is an ongoing debate regarding the dominant mode of galaxy growth at early times—whether it is driven by smooth gas accretion ("cold flows") or hierarchical merging; this paper provides quantitative constraints suggesting mergers are secondary to in-situ star formation.

### [MIGHTEE HI observations of low surface brightness and ultra-diffuse galaxies in the XMM-LSS field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18128)

**Authors:** Elizabeth A. K. Adams, Barbara \v{S}iljeg, Anastasia Ponomareva, Natasha Maddox, Pavel Enrique Mancera Pi\~na, Maarten Baes, Bradley Frank, Marcin Glowacki, et al. (11 total)
**Relevance Score:** 8.0/10

#### 1. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY
Using untargeted MIGHTEE HI observations, researchers identified 29 low surface brightness galaxies (mostly ultra-diffuse) that were largely missed by optical surveys, finding them to be gas-rich and generally consistent with standard scaling relations.

#### 2. KEY FINDINGS
- **Main Result:** The study identified 29 LSBGs via HI detection, 26 of which qualify as ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with effective radii $R_{eff} > 1.5$ kpc; only 3 of these were previously detected in optical catalogs.
- **Methodology:** The analysis utilized MIGHTEE HI early science data covering the XMM-LSS field, cross-matching with optical catalogs and performing surface brightness photometry on HI detections.
- **Unexpected Result:** While HI-selected LSBGs tend to be bluer, they overlap significantly with optically selected samples in surface brightness and size, making it difficult to pinpoint why they were missed optically.
- **Broader Context:** Three out of four HI-selected UDGs with kinematic data follow the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, suggesting these gas-rich systems behave like "normal" galaxies despite their diffuse nature (though the sample is small and biased against low rotational velocities).

#### 3. KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Observational Paper Details:**
- **Methodology:** The authors cross-referenced untargeted HI spectral line data with optical catalogs. They performed surface brightness photometry on HI detections to classify LSBGs and UDGs. For optically identified galaxies without HI detections, they extracted spectra to place upper limits on HI-to-stellar mass ratios.
- **Note on Claims:** The finding that UDGs follow the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation is based on a very small sample ($N=4$) and is biased against low rotational velocities due to spectral resolution limitations; this result requires verification with larger samples.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sample size | 29 HI-selected LSBGs (26 UDGs) |
| Redshift range | Not specified in abstract |
| Key instruments | MeerKAT (MIGHTEE Survey) |
| Data products | MIGHTEE HI XMM-LSS early science data, Optical LSBG catalogs |
| Citation to note | MIGHTEE survey references |

#### 4. DATASETS AND TOOLS
- MIGHTEE HI XMM-LSS early science data
- Publicly available catalogs of optically identified LSBGs

#### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE FROM INTRODUCTION
- Untargeted neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys provide a critical, complementary method for identifying gas-rich low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) that are overlooked by traditional optical searches.
- A key open question in the field involves the physical distinction (or lack thereof) between galaxies selected by gas content versus stellar surface brightness.
- Understanding the detection limits and selection biases in both optical and radio regimes is essential for characterizing the true population of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs).

### [Molecular Gas Excitation in z ~ 0.7 Gas-Rich Post-starburst Galaxies from SQuIGGLE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17766)

**Authors:** Vincenzo R. D'Onofrio, Justin S. Spilker, Rachel Bezanson, Robert Feldmann, Andy D. Goulding, Jenny E. Greene, Mariska Kriek, Anika Kumar, et al. (13 total)
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

*   **Main Question:** This study investigates why gas-rich post-starburst galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ exhibit low star formation rates despite retaining substantial molecular gas reservoirs.
*   **Methodology:** The authors analyze molecular gas excitation using new ALMA CO(5-4) observations combined with existing CO(2-1) data for nine galaxies from the SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E survey.
*   **Key Result:** The sample predominantly shows moderate gas excitation ($r_{52} \approx 0.1-0.3$) and modest star formation surface densities, although one galaxy with an active galactic nucleus shows significantly elevated excitation ($r_{52}\approx0.6$).
*   **Significance:** The findings indicate that the suppressed star formation in these systems is due to low star formation efficiency rather than hidden, intense starburst activity.

### [Scaling Relations across Galaxy Classification Schemes: I. Star Formation Rate-Stellar Mass Plane of CALIFA Nearby Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17928)

**Authors:** Veselina Kalinova, Keiichi Kodaira, Dario Colombo
**Relevance Score:** 7.0/10

*   **Main Question:** This study investigates the mechanisms driving galaxy evolution and morphological transitions by examining the relationship between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass.
*   **Methodology:** The authors analyze 231 nearby CALIFA galaxies using three complementary classification schemes: Hubble type (structure), circular velocity curves (gravitational potential), and quenching stages (spatial extent of star formation).
*   **Key Result:** A clear stratification is found on the SFR-stellar mass plane, where late-type spirals dominate the star-forming blue cloud, early-type spirals populate the transitional green valley, and elliptical/lenticular galaxies reside on the quenched red sequence.
*   **Significance:** The results demonstrate a tight link between galaxy structure, gravitational potential, and star-formation suppression, revealing that while some morphological groups have unique dynamical properties, others represent complex transitional stages.

### [A Bayesian Exploration of the Mass of Ursa Major III: Kinematics, Rotation and their influence on the Mass to Light Ratio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17957)

**Authors:** T. R. Adams, B. J. Brewer, G. F. Lewis
**Relevance Score:** 5.0/10

*   This study investigates the nature of the ambiguous stellar system UMa III/U1, specifically testing whether it is an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy or a star cluster by searching for intrinsic rotation.
*   The authors apply Bayesian inference to compare rotating and non-rotating kinematic models using the stellar population, including tests with potential contaminants removed.
*   The analysis strongly favors a non-rotating model by a factor of 5–12 and calculates a lower-bound mass-to-light ratio of $734.4^{+339.0}_{-176.2} \mathrm{M_\odot} / \mathrm{L_\odot}$.
*   These results suggest UMa III/U1 is not supported by rotational pressure, leaving its classification as a galaxy or star cluster unresolved but constraining its dynamical state.
